PowerLab is in `v0.x`, breaking changes can land in MINOR bumps; from
`v1.0` onward we commit to backwards compatibility within MAJOR.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## How entries land here

Each PR adds a tiny YAML fragment under `.changes/unreleased/<id>.yaml`.
At release time, `changie batch <version>` aggregates the fragments into
a new section below this header. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the workflow.

## [v0.6.3] — 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- Umbrel-catalog import — Phase 7.5 (#307) — extends the volume placeholder substitution to catch two more Umbrel-ecosystem variables surfaced by the new CI gate. `${APP_<NAME>_DATA_DIR}` (sibling-app data dirs — e.g. an app referencing `${APP_LIGHTNING_NODE_DATA_DIR}`) and `${UMBREL_ROOT}` (Umbrel installation root, used by apps that read from the shared `/data/storage/downloads` tree) now substitute to PowerLab paths so the catalog parses. The new `production_catalog_test.go` walks every `community-catalog/Apps/<id>/ docker-compose.yml` in the repo and feeds it through the SAME loader BuildCatalog uses at runtime — a CI gate that blocks any release carrying a broken catalog. Caught 18 apps that would have shipped broken in v0.6.3 (agora, audiobookshelf, bazarr, downtify, duplicati, emby, file-browser, home-assistant, jackett, …). Catalog re-emitted + verified: 245 apps in `community-catalog/Apps/`, 245/245 parse.


## [v0.6.2] — 2026-05-12
### Fixed
- Umbrel-catalog import — Phase 7 (#307) — the v0.6.1 release shipped a populated `community-catalog/` directory but 0 Umbrel apps surfaced in the store, because every emitted compose YAML carried Umbrel-runtime patterns that PowerLab's compose-go validator rejects: `services.app_proxy` without an `image:` (Umbrel runtime helper), `${APP_DATA_DIR}` un-substituted in volume references (compose-go treats as undefined named-volume), `env_file:` pointing at paths that don't exist at parse time, `${APP_*_PORT}` placeholders inside `ports:` (compose-go port parser is strict), and missing top-level `name:` (compose project name fell back to a random temp-dir basename, so `BuildCatalog` keyed the app under names like `amazing_ubs` instead of `agent-zero` — present in the API but unreachable by id). `backend/sync-catalog/transform.go` rewrites the upstream compose to handle all five patterns at sync time. End-to-end verification on a v0.6.1 install: catalog grew from 162 (CasaOS-only) to 336 apps; 10 representative Umbrel-only ids (agent-zero, affine, enclosed, adventurelog, appsmith, audiobookshelf, excalidraw, 2fauth, activepieces, akaunting) all resolve by their hyphenated upstream ids. Regression locked by: `backend/sync-catalog/transform_test.go` (20+ unit tests covering each transform individually plus edge cases — empty input, malformed YAML, null/int volume entries, multi-service substitution, idempotency, substring-not-match) and `backend/app-management/service/umbrel_catalog_integration_test.go` (loader-level round trip: emit → `NewComposeAppFromYAML` parse → assert no error + correct project name). The integration test is the missing TDD piece that would have caught the v0.6.1 ship bug — it walks `testdata/umbrel-fixtures/Apps/*/docker-compose.yml` and feeds each through the SAME compose loader BuildCatalog uses.


## [v0.6.1] — 2026-05-12
### Added
- Umbrel-catalog wire-up — Phase 4.5 (#307) — registers the local `community-catalog/` directory as a third app store source so apps synced by the weekly sync workflow show up in the PowerLab catalog UI without further configuration. Dev conf (`backend/app-management/app-management.conf`) reads `../../community-catalog`; production sample + bundled `install.sh` create `/var/lib/powerlab/community-catalog/` and ship pre-bundled apps in the release tarball. `community-catalog/.gitkeep` is committed so the dir exists before the first sync run. Adds `backend/sync-catalog/sync-catalog` build artifact to .gitignore.
- AppCard now shows a discrete **source badge** in the metadata row indicating which upstream catalog the app came from (#307 Phase 5). Apple-style: tiny muted text after the category, never a colored pill or brand chip. Source is detected from `store_info.source.catalog` when the backend populates it (Umbrel-synced apps), otherwise inferred from the icon URL: `getumbrel.github.io` → umbrel, `IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore` → casaos, `bigbeartechworld/big-bear` → big-bear. Apps with no recognized source show the generic label "store" so every tile surfaces some provenance. The badge is a click-through link to the upstream repository when known (opens in a new tab; click does NOT bubble to the outer card handler). Native `title` tooltip carries the synced_at date when present.
### Fixed
- Password UX during onboarding (#306) — fixed off-by-one where the UI guard rejected `< 5` chars and the backend rejected `< 6`, surfacing the resulting validation failure as a generic "Failed to initialize the system" message. Both surfaces now agree on a minimum of 8 characters (locked by the new `MinPasswordLen` constant in `backend/user-service/route/v1/password.go` + the `MIN_PASSWORD_LEN` constant in SetupWizard.svelte; regression tests on each side pin the value). Backend error codes (PWD_IS_TOO_SIMPLE / KEY_NOT_EXIST / USER_EXIST) now map to specific i18n keys (`error.passTooShortBackend`, `error.setupKeyExpired`, `error.userExists`) in en/pt-BR/es, so the user sees a meaningful message instead of "check the backend logs". Helper text under the password input shows the rule upfront ("Mínimo 8 caracteres") and turns emerald when the floor is met; a checkmark icon appears inside the input. The Finish button is disabled until both gates pass (length + match) instead of only when fields are empty.
- Sync-umbrel-catalog workflow no longer fails silently when the `catalog` label is missing on the repo. `gh pr create --label X` validates the label upfront and exits non-zero if it doesn't exist — leaving the branch pushed but no PR open (the workflow's `|| true` swallowed the error). Split into a separate `gh pr edit --add-label` step that runs after PR creation, with the label step being best-effort. First-run symptom: first weekly sync after #317 pushed the branch but skipped the PR open.
### Internal
- Umbrel-catalog sync pipeline — Phase 1 (#307) — new `backend/sync-catalog/` binary clones the public Umbrel App Store catalog and emits PowerLab-native `appfile.json` per allowed app via a clean-room transform (ADR-0024). Four-tier filter (Tier 1 hard-reject `getumbrel/*` images + cross-app sibling env vars; Tier 2 soft-reject Bitcoin/Lightning categories by default; Tier 4 allow everything else). 23 unit tests; real-world dry-run against 330 upstream apps produces 241 allow / 44 hard-reject / 45 soft-reject / 0 parse-errors. Each emitted appfile carries a `source` provenance block (catalog, upstream commit, upstream path, transform version, synced_at) — answers the "debug origem" requirement. Icon URL is a pass-through to upstream `getumbrel.github.io/umbrel-apps-gallery/<id>/icon.svg`; descriptions are fetched from each app's OWN upstream README (the app maintainer's OSS-licensed content, not Umbrel's curated description), with optional `description-powerlab.md` maintainer override.
- Umbrel-catalog sync pipeline — Phase 3 (#307) — `.github/workflows/sync-umbrel-catalog.yml` runs Monday 06:00 UTC + on `workflow_dispatch`. Builds the sync-catalog binary from Phase 1 (#310), runs it against the upstream, commits the diff to a date-stamped `catalog/umbrel-sync-YYYY-MM-DD` branch and opens a PR with the filter summary + diff-stat for human review. No-op when there is no diff vs main; dry-run flag available via the manual dispatch UI. Concurrency group cancels older scheduled runs when a manual trigger fires. Local equivalent: `make sync-catalog` and `make sync-catalog-dry`.
- Umbrel-catalog sync pipeline — Phase 4 (#307) — refactors emit.go to CasaOS-compatible output shape so `backend/app-management/service.BuildCatalog` picks up the synced apps without further wiring. Layout changes from `apps/<id>/appfile.json` (custom format I'd invented in Phase 1 based on a misread of ADR-0021) to `Apps/<id>/docker-compose.yml` (verbatim upstream YAML with a top-level `x-powerlab:` block appended containing store_app_id, title, tagline, icon URL, category, port_map, author + the `source` provenance sub-block). 6 emit tests updated; dry-run against 330 upstream apps unchanged (241/44/45/0/0). The legal posture in ADR-0024 still holds — the upstream docker-compose.yml is functional config (factual: image refs, ports, env names), the only expressive content (descriptions, screenshots) was already dropped at the parser stage.
- Umbrel-catalog sync pipeline — Phase 6 (#307) — adds a `sync-catalog --validate-only=<dir>` flag that walks `community-catalog/Apps/*/docker-compose.yml` and asserts shape invariants without running a sync: file parses as YAML, has top-level `services:` + `x-powerlab:`, the `x-powerlab.store_app_id` / `title.en_us` / `source.catalog` fields are non-empty, and `x-powerlab.icon` (if present) parses as a URL. Exit 0 clean / exit 1 with per-rule error lines suitable for CI. 12 unit tests cover happy path, empty catalog, missing dir (no-op), malformed YAML, each required field missing, multiple errors per app, deterministic ordering. Usable in CI to gate weekly sync PRs and locally by maintainers editing description-powerlab.md / icon overrides.


## [v0.6.0] — 2026-05-11
### Internal
- ADR renumber chore — the duplicate ADR-0011 and ADR-0012 numbers (CA series filed 2026-05-07 in one branch, foundation `backend/pkg/` series filed 2026-05-08 in another) are resolved by renumbering the foundation pair to ADR-0025 (`backend-pkg-coexistence-with-casaos-common`) and ADR-0026 (`pkg-logging-built-on-stdlib-slog`). ADR-0011/0012 are now unambiguously the CA-mismatch + CA-rotation ADRs. Cross-references updated across `backend/`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `.changes/`. Each renumbered ADR carries a "Renumber history" note for traceability. `decisions/README.md` index brought current (0023 + 0025 + 0026 now listed). Closes the action item flagged in `docs/audits/quality-and-tech-debt-2026-05-10.md`.
- Backend integration coverage Phase 1+2 (#150) — wires `go test -coverprofile` per service in CI with 14-day artifact upload, lands HTTP-surface regression locks asserting `/v1/cloud/*`, `/v1/driver/*`, `/v1/recover/*`, `/v1/sys/version/check` and `/v1/sys/update` return 404 on both core and local-storage. Baseline: core 6.1%, app-management 15.5% (local-storage measured by CI Linux runner). Phases 3 (testcontainers) and 4 (fuse build-tag) deferred to Sprint 12+.
- Frontend vitest coverage lifted from 16.77% baseline (Sprint 9) to **28.75% statements / 24.21% branches / 26.41% functions / 29.60% lines** — all four Sprint 11 targets met. 23 new test files: 5 store tests (theme/ui/system/settings/versionHandshake), 5 settings panes (AppsPane/GeneralPane/NetworkPane/SecurityPane/AboutPane), 3 apps modals (ForkAppModal/UninstallAppModal/UpdateAppModal), AppCard, 3 dashboard widgets (MiniProgress/RadialGauge/Sparkline), plus utility regression locks (`compose-name` for #240, `compose-extension` for ADR-0021 priority chain, `format`, expanded `os`). Small extraction: `lib/utils/compose-name.ts` lifts the Docker Compose service-name validation out of `apps/new/+page.svelte` so the contract is unit-tested independently. Test count: 230 → 401 passing. Closes #296.


## [v0.5.13] — 2026-05-11
### Added
- **Headline v0.6 feature**: Dashboard storage card now exposes per-drive **SMART status + temperature** badges (closes #255). Backend already populated `Disk.Temperature` + `Disk.Health` from `smartctl` — UI was throwing the data away. New `Drive Health` section under the existing storage usage rows lists each physical disk with model + bus type + temperature (color-coded: <50°C green, 50–59°C amber, ≥60°C red) + SMART OK/FAIL pill. Smartctl-unavailable hosts (macOS dev, containers without /dev passthrough) render gracefully — badges hide when values are 0/empty. Storage device list polls every 10th utilization tick to keep smartctl call frequency low. 3 locale strings added (en/es/pt-BR).
### Changed
- Settings → App Sources card now labels the third-party AppStore as "Community catalog" instead of "CasaOS catalog". i18n key renamed `settings.casaCatalog` → `settings.communityCatalog` in all 3 locales (en/es/pt-BR). The hardcoded `<p>CasaOS catalog</p>` literal in `+page.svelte` now uses `{t(...)}` properly. The underlying URL (cdn.jsdelivr.net/.../CasaOS-AppStore@gh-pages) is unchanged — content sourcing decision is ADR-0021. Closes #250.
- Internal API surface rebrand (#251): renamed `backend/core/route/v2.CasaOS` struct + `NewCasaOS()` constructor to `Server` / `NewServer()` (the type implements the v2 codegen ServerInterface; "Server" is the conventional name and gets rid of branding in godoc + IDE autocomplete). Renamed message-bus SourceID `SERVICENAME = "casaos"` → `"powerlab"` in `backend/core/common/constants.go` — UI consumers filter by event Name, not SourceID, so the rename is invisible to clients. Removed orphan `RANW_NAME = "IceWhale-RemoteAccess"` constant (zero callers, CasaOS-era remote-access tunnel identifier we never adopted). Closes #251.
### Removed
- Delete two confirmed-dead source files: `backend/core/route/v1/notify_old.go` (62 LOC, zero callers — superseded by `notify.go` long ago) and `backend/app-management/cmd/migration-tool/migration_0412_and_older.go` (77 LOC, orphaned constructor never wired into `main.go`). 139 LOC of dead weight removed; zero behavioural change. First batch of the Sprint 8 kill-list (~17.7k LOC total queued).
- Remove the entire Samba/SMB feature surface — UI never consumed any of the 7 Samba endpoints, and the user explicitly removed Samba from PowerLab's product scope on 2026-05-11. Drops 813 LOC net (9 full-file deletes + 11 surgical edits + go-smb2 dependency). Files-page coupling was 3 cosmetic annotations the UI never read. Closes the Samba kill of the Sprint 8 kill-list (~17.7k LOC total queued).
- Delete `backend/app-management/cmd/appfile2compose/` (95 LOC) — CasaOS-era one-shot tool that converted the legacy `appfile.json` format to docker-compose YAML. PowerLab's App Store has been 100% native compose YAML for the entire fork's history; the binary was never invoked from any script, install path, or Makefile target. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 3/5.
- Quick-win sweep of CasaOS-era orphan files: 40 dead workflow files (.github/workflows/ inside backend/* — GitHub Actions only honors top-level .github), 5 orphan sysroot files (casaos.service unit, rclone.service unit, mergerfs.ctl, env file with stub key, app-management/env), backend/core/Makefile ("call john"), the dead `model.DeviceInfo` type + `systemService.GetDeviceInfo()` method (zero callers), 3 dead UI endpoint constants (ZT_INFO, SYS_PORT, GATEWAY_PORT) + ZTInfo type, plus 4 string cleanups: swagger contact rebrand (zimaboard.com → PowerLab), random.go "Zimaboard backers" comment, and the "Casa" → "PowerLab" device-discovery fallback in route/init.go (the most visible "pretending to be CasaOS on the LAN" residue). Sprint 8 kill-list batch 4/5; 1709 LOC removed, 48 files changed.
- Remove network-feature surface that does not belong in PowerLab core: ZeroTier (entire `/v1/zt/*` proxy + `/v2/casaos/zt/*` v2 endpoints + httper helper, ~440 LOC), `WsSsh` + `PostSshLogin` (CasaOS SSH-to-other-host browser terminal — local pty `WsShell` for "open a shell on this server" stays untouched, ~113 LOC), CasaOS Snapdrop-style peer-broadcast `file_websocket.go` (`/v1/file/ws` + `/v1/file/peers`, closes #261, ~315 LOC), and the orphan `pkg/ddns/` constants (zero callers, ~15 LOC). Net: 11 files changed, 915 LOC removed. Aligned with the architectural principle that VPN/DDNS/SMB belong as App Store apps, not core orchestrator features. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 5/9.
- Delete dev-only standalone main packages that no script ever invokes: `backend/app-management/cmd/validator/` (411 LOC, validated CasaOS appfile.json — but PowerLab installs do compose validation inline in `service/compose_service.go`), and `cmd/message-bus-docgen/` in 3 services (~94 LOC, generated markdown docs nobody publishes — Scalar + openapi.yaml cover this). 7 files removed, 505 LOC. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 6/9.
- Remove the `cmd/migration-tool/` Go binary tree across all 6 backend services (1248 LOC, 22 files). The CasaOS-era pattern of "run a separate Go binary before service start to migrate v0.x.y → v0.x.z data paths" was never used in production: `package-linux.sh` does not build it, `install.sh` does not invoke it, and `scripts/migrate-casaos-data.sh` already covers the full filesystem-level CasaOS → PowerLab migration sourced by install.sh. Also drop the now-orphan `MigrationTool` interface in `backend/common/interfaces.go` and `backend/core/interfaces/migrationTool.go`. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 7/9.
- Delete the entire `backend/cli/` subproject (4840 LOC across 61 files). The legacy CasaOS CLI binary was never built (`package-linux.sh` SERVICES list excludes it), never distributed (install.sh has zero refs), and explicitly skipped by CI (workflow comment: "cli is excluded — its codegen sub-packages live in a separate repository (CasaOS-CLI) that we have not forked yet"). All operator paths flow through the SvelteKit panel + Docker orchestration; CLI maintenance was pure overhead. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 8/9 — biggest single delete of the wave.
- Remove the entire app-management `/v1/*` API surface (1365 LOC). UI consumes only `/v2/app_management/*`; the v1 handlers (`AppUsageList`, `ContainerUpdateInfo`, `ToComposeYAML`, `DockerTerminal`, `UninstallApp`, `UpdateSetting`, `ArchiveContainer`, `GetDockerNetworks`) were CasaOS legacy with zero callers. Drops route/v1/ entire dir, route/v1.go, the v1 OpenAPI spec, the v1 Scalar docs HTML, and the gateway routing entries `/v1/apps`, `/v1/container`, `/v1/app-categories`, `route.V1DocPath`. Sprint 8 kill-list batch 9/9 — final batch of the wave.
- Drop 10 dead `/v1/users/*` endpoints in user-service that no UI route + no `backend/common/external` caller ever invoked: `/users/{name, refresh, image, avatar}`, `/users/current/{custom/:key, image/:key}`, `/users/{:id DELETE, :username GET, "" DELETE}`. Single-user PowerLab does not exercise multi-user CRUD, avatars, or custom-conf storage. Keeps the 5 endpoints UI actually uses: `register`, `login`, `status`, `current GET`/`current PUT`, `current/password`. Net: 527 LOC removed (route/v1.go: 27 LOC trimmed; route/v1/user.go: 520 LOC of handlers + now-unused imports). Sprint 9 PR K (split-out from Sprint 8 PR Q scope).
### Fixed
- Sprint 8 PR B — convert 3 remaining panics in
`backend/local-storage/service/disk.go` to logged error +
return false. Audit #216 §C item 2 follow-up; same pattern
as PR #230 (GetDownloadSingleFile fix).

Affected lines:
  - line 135 (was: panic on GetMergeAllFromDB error)
  - line 159 (was: panic in else-branch of CreateMerge errors)
  - line 192 (was: panic on CreateMergeInDB error)

All 3 are inside `EnsureDefaultMergePoint() bool` — both
callers (main.go boot path + route/v2/merge.go enable
endpoint) already handle false gracefully ("mergerfs is
disabled" log + config flip / "default merge point is not
empty" 400 response). The pkg/lifecycle recover middleware
was catching these today and dressing them up as 500s; now
the proper "mergerfs disabled" path runs instead.

Closes audit #216 §C entirely (the 4th panic in disk.go
is inside a commented-out block).

- Sprint 8 PR C — fix #50: CA download "Security Profile" /
"CRT file" / "CA Certificate" links inside the Settings →
Security walkthrough lists were `<a href="/v1/sys/ca-
certificate.X">` anchors that bypassed the JS-driven
`downloadCA()` helper.

When the handler returned an error (CA not yet generated, or
storage path unreadable), the browser navigated to the URL +
rendered the plain-text error in place of the SPA — same
class of "stranded outside the app" UX as the v0.2.7 trust-
dance test bug.

Fix: replaced the 5 inline anchors with `<button>` elements
that call `downloadCA(format)` (which already had the
fetch-based pre-flight + toast.error on failure + no-page-
navigation behavior, in use by the bottom CTAs since #118
prep).

Per memory `feedback_no_text_cert.md`, the cert remains a
binary artifact (.crt / .mobileconfig / .cer) — no copy-to-
clipboard PEM, no .txt rename. Only the trigger surface
changed.

Verified: 10/10 E2E pass locally (3.7s).

- Custom App name field now shows inline validation error (red border + helper text under input) when empty or contains invalid characters. Previously the only feedback was a toast on Deploy + tooltip on the disabled button, leaving users guessing why their input was rejected. Closes
- Files page now exposes a select-all checkbox in the table header so the toolbar Delete button is reachable without Cmd/Ctrl-click chord shortcuts. The header checkbox is tri-state (checked / indeterminate / unchecked) and toggles `store.selectAll` ↔ `store.clearSelection`. Closes #66.
- Editing an existing Custom App and re-deploying no longer fails with "there are ports in use" when the only conflict is the app's own running ports. The orchestrator now routes edit-mode (URL has `?id=X` without `&fork=1`) to the PUT applyComposeAppSettings endpoint, which carries the backend's skip-self port-conflict logic. POST install is unchanged. Closes #65.
- Health endpoint (`/v2/casaos/health/services`) now queries BOTH `casaos*` and `powerlab-*` systemd glob patterns instead of just `casaos*`. PowerLab fresh installs (where units are named `powerlab-*`) previously got an empty health dashboard because the legacy glob never matched. Co-resident installs (operator migrating from CasaOS with `casaos-*` units still present) continue to surface the legacy units too. Results are deduped across globs. Closes #245.
- fstab writes now create `.powerlab.bak` / `.powerlab.new` backup files and a `# Added by PowerLab` marker comment on each appended line, instead of the legacy `.casaos.bak` / `.casaos.new` / `# Added by the CasaOS`. Surprises co-resident installs migrating from CasaOS where those names overlap real CasaOS-written files; harmless on greenfield installs. Existing `.casaos.bak` files on disk are not consumed by code (backup-only artifacts) so no migration step is required. Closes #248.
- Custom App tile click in the Launchpad now opens the app in a new tab even when the user didn't fill the "Web UI Port (Host Port)" field explicitly (#278). The orchestrator now falls back to the first host port from the `ports:` mapping when `web_port` is empty, so a basic Compose like `ports: [8080:80]` produces a clickable tile out-of-the-box — matching native-app tile behavior. Explicit `web_port` still wins. Closes #278.
- Fresh `package-linux.sh` installs now ship the `[security] AllowedOrigins=` section in `/etc/powerlab/message-bus.conf` (Sprint 8 #241 carry-forward). Previously only the embedded sysroot conf.sample carried the section, so operators editing `/etc/powerlab/message-bus.conf` after fresh install found the section missing. Default value is empty (same-origin-only — secure default per ADR-0023); no behaviour change.
### Security
- message-bus SocketIO transports (websocket + polling) now enforce an Origin allowlist instead of unconditionally accepting `return true`. Same-origin requests pass without configuration; cross-origin callers must be listed in the new `[security] AllowedOrigins` section of `message-bus.conf`. Closes #219, ADR-0023.
- Replace 2 hardcoded `"casaos"` literals shipped as PowerLab defaults: (a) `DefaultPassword` substituted into every newly installed Compose app via `$DefaultPassword` placeholder is now `"powerlab"` (closes #243), and (b) Docker registry probe `User-Agent` is now `PowerLab/{AppManagementVersion}` instead of the literal `CasaOS` (closes #244 — branding leak + private-registry log fingerprinting). TDD: 3 regression tests authored failing-first, then implemented.
- JWT access tokens are now issued with `iss="powerlab"` instead of the legacy `"casaos"` (closes #246). The bridging-release accept set in `AcceptedAccessIssuers` lets legacy `iss=casaos` tokens validate too so existing sessions don't get logged out on upgrade — that path drops in v0.7. Also adds a missing access-token issuer gate to `Validate`: refresh tokens (iss=refresh) and tokens from unknown issuers now correctly fail the access path (previously they passed the signature check and were accepted as access tokens, a real bug). Refresh-endpoint code paths use `ParseToken` directly and are unaffected.
### Internal
- Add Playwright regression coverage for the v0.3.0 Files-editor inert-textarea bug (#57). The vitest suite already covered `.cm-editor` mount in jsdom; this adds production-fidelity coverage that opens the editor through the real click flow, types via the actual keyboard pipeline, and asserts the dirty-indicator flips on. The original regression was fixed in earlier polish cycles (v0.3.2 / #116 / #121); this PR locks the fix in place. Closes #57.
- Frontend coverage measurement infrastructure (Sprint 9 PR I). Adds `@vitest/coverage-v8`, configures vitest with the v8 provider + text/html/json-summary reporters, exposes `npm run test:coverage`, and wires CI to upload `ui/coverage/` as a 14-day artifact on every push. Baseline established at **16.77 % statements** (1261/7517) — documented in `docs/audits/frontend-coverage-baseline.md` with targets for Sprint 10 + the v0.6 cut gate. No threshold gates yet; Sprint 10 retro decides the floor.
- Sprint 7 carry-forward kicked off (#123): extract the `apps` section of `settings/+page.svelte` into `lib/components/settings/AppsPane.svelte` as the pattern-proving PR. Net reduction 46 LOC on the god file (1469 → 1423); the new component takes 3 props (`storagePath`, `copiedKey`, `onCopy`) so future panes follow the same shape. 4 remaining panes (general/network/security/about) carry forward to Sprint 10 — each needs user smoke-test in browser per Sprint 7 retro's "user is the verification gate" rule. vitest: 239/239 pass.
- Sprint 10 PR A — extract `GeneralPane.svelte` (~145 LOC) from `settings/+page.svelte` (1423 → 1294 LOC, -129). Component takes 9 props (osHostname, timezone, onTimezoneChange, reachableUrl, currentPort, portInput, onPortInputChange, onRequestPortChange, timezones); locale picker calls `setLocale/getLocale/availableLocales` directly (no parent wiring needed). Port-change flow + reboot/shutdown power UI moved inside the pane. Continues #123 carry-forward — 3 panes left (Network, Security, About).
- Sprint 10 PR B — extract `NetworkPane.svelte` (~85 LOC) from `settings/+page.svelte` (1294 → 1227 LOC, -67). Component takes 5 props (mdnsHostname, reachableUrl, copiedKey, onCopy, networkInterfaces). Continues #123 carry-forward — 2 panes left (Security, About).
- Sprint 10 PR C — extract `SecurityPane.svelte` (~250 LOC) from `settings/+page.svelte` (1227 → 1011 LOC, -216). The biggest pane: HTTPS onboarding walkthrough (4 OS tabs — iOS/macOS/Android/Windows), CA download buttons, HTTP-fallback for blocked downloads, verification button, reset-trust + rotate-CA recovery actions, account section. 9 props (state + 5 callbacks). Continues #123 carry-forward — 1 pane left (About).
- Sprint 10 PR D — extract `AboutPane.svelte` (~280 LOC) from `settings/+page.svelte`, finishing the 5-pane settings split (#123). The pane is mostly static markup (hero, highlights grid, "built with" chips, resources, footer) plus the updater store check/install UI. Reads directly from `$lib/stores/updater.svelte` — no parent wiring needed; zero props. **Settings page final: 1469 → 739 LOC (-730 / 50% reduction).** Closes #123. Apps/+page split (1561 LOC) carries to Sprint 11.
- Sprint 10 PR E — extract 3 modal components from `apps/+page.svelte` (1561 → 1492 LOC, -69): `ForkAppModal`, `UninstallAppModal`, `UpdateAppModal`. Each takes minimal props (open + callbacks). Pattern-proving PR for #123 carry on apps page. Larger modals (Install confirm with port-conflict UI, Detail modal, Install fullscreen + minimized banner) stay in the orchestrator — they have heavy state interaction and need user smoke gate. Continues #123.
- Sprint 10 PR G — implement-or-delete the 2 Go `t.Skip("MUST FIX!")` tests that violated memory `feedback_no_apagar_test_para_passar`. (1) Rewrite `backend/core/service/file_test.go::TestNewInteruptReader` as 6 proper unit tests for `NewReader`/`NewWriter` context-cancellation (was a 10-second sleep loop reading from upstream CasaOS dev's hardcoded `/Users/liangjianli/Downloads/` path with no assertions). (2) Delete `backend/core/pkg/utils/network_detection.go` + its test entirely — zero production callers, dead code from CasaOS era; drops the `github.com/Curtis-Milo/nat-type-identifier-go` dependency. 13 LOC removed from go.mod/sum.


## [v0.5.12] — 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- Sprint 5.5 quality wave — 3 quick-win fixes from the audit
at `docs/audits/quality-and-tech-debt-2026-05-10.md` (PR #216):

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md license bug** — declared "PolyForm
   Noncommercial License 1.0.0" but the actual `LICENSE` file
   is AGPL-3.0 (matched by README, SECURITY.md, mkdocs site).
   Single-line legal contract bug; corrected to AGPL-3.0.

2. **README stale facts** — install command pinned `v0.1.5`
   (current is v0.5.11); architecture diagram showed gateway
   on `:80 / :443` (real ports `:8765 / :8443`).

3. **ADR index outdated** — `docs/decisions/README.md` listed
   only ADRs 0001-0012; missing 11 newer ADRs (including the
   governance-critical ADR-0019, ADR-0020 JWT keypair,
   ADR-0021 coexistence, ADR-0022 CasaOS-abandoned). Added all
   missing entries + a note explaining the duplicate 0011/0012
   numbering (two files at each ID because they landed in
   parallel branches).

- Sprint 6 #1 — kill the flaky `TestSearch` in
`backend/core/service/other_test.go` that randomly broke CI
with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace'` ... wait,
that was the mkdocs one. The Go test broke with goleak detecting
a still-running DNS lookup goroutine on `www.baidu.com` after
the test's wg.Wait() returned (resty's underlying transport
goroutine outlived the test).

Root cause: `Search()` was DEAD CODE — the only call site in
`route/v1/other.go:20` had been commented out. The function
fanned out HTTP calls to 5 search engines for typeahead
suggestions, but the route handler used `AgentSearch()`
(the URL-proxy variant) instead.

Fix: deleted dead code. Removed:
  - `OtherService.Search()` method + entire body
  - `model.SearchEngine` type (used only by Search)
  - `TestSearch` test (no longer applicable)
  - Commented-out call site in `route/v1/other.go`

Bonus: kept `AgentSearch` with proper godoc + an SSRF-shape
warning comment (since it'll fetch any URL, behind JWT auth).

Net diff: -160 LOC, eliminates a recurring CI flake (PR #190
hit it; PR #203 hit it; PR #214 hit it; PR #215 hit it).

### Internal
- Sprint 5 obliterate-CasaOS wave 2 — eliminates the runtime
`icon.casaos.io` dependency + sweeps the dead-CasaOS-build-
artifact tree across all 5 backend services. Per ADR-0022,
no runtime deps on upstream CasaOS infrastructure remain.

## Kill #9 (icon CDN)

`service/container.go::ContainerList` no longer synthesises
icon URLs by calling `https://icon.casaos.io/main/all/<image>.png`
for system-origin containers. Falls through to the container's
own icon label or the UI's MyAppList fallback.

## Dead-build sweep (~80 files)

Pattern: same as PR #208's gateway cleanup. None of these were
referenced by `scripts/package-linux.sh` (PowerLab's actual
install pipeline). All inherited CasaOS-era artifacts shipped
with the source tarball as cruft:

  backend/<svc>/build/scripts/setup/service.d/**/setup-*.sh
  backend/<svc>/build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/**

Across: app-management, message-bus, core, local-storage,
user-service.

## .goreleaser configs (~14 files)

`.goreleaser.yaml` + `.goreleaser.debug.yaml` per service.
PowerLab uses `scripts/package-linux.sh` for releases, not
goreleaser. The configs reference
`github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppManagement/cmd/appfile2compose`
which was the upstream release pipeline — dead.

## Cosmetic

`ui/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte` About card link
"Powered by CasaOS" → "PowerLab on GitHub" pointing at our
own repo.

## Net diff

~80 files deleted, 2 modified. Build verified for all
services that build on macOS (local-storage's pre-existing
fuse/netlink issue unaffected).

- Sprint 5.5 quality wave (#196) — gateway godoc raise from
21% → 85%, second module surfaced on docs site after pkg/*.

9 exported decls gained godoc:
  - common.LoadConfig
  - service.NewMDNSService
  - service.Management + NewManagementService
  - service.State + NewState
  - route.GatewayRoute + NewGatewayRoute
  - route.ManagementRoute + NewManagementRoute
  - route.StaticRoute + NewStaticRoute
  - route.NewSecurityRoute
  - route.NewDocsRoute

Implementation:
  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh restructured to support N modules under
    docs/api/<mod>/. MODULES list now includes "gateway" alongside
    "pkg".
  - .gitignore generalised: docs/api/*/*.md ignored, only
    index.md per module is committed (was hard-coded to pkg's
    6 files).
  - mkdocs.yml nav grows a "gateway" sub-section under "Go API
    reference".
  - docs/api/gateway/index.md committed as the curated landing.

Per-service raise plan (#196): gateway done ✅, message-bus +
user-service next (smallest remaining at 17% / 40%).

- Sprint 5.5 quality wave (#196) — user-service godoc raise from
40% → 57%. **Below the 70% bar to surface on the docs site**;
needs a follow-up PR for the 12 route-handler godocs to clear
the gap.

10 high-leverage decls gained godoc:
  - service: Repository, NewService, UserService, EventService,
    NewEventService
  - model: EventModel, CommonModel, APPModel, Result
  - model/system_model: VerifyInformation
  - route: InitRouter, InitV2Router, InitV2DocRouter
  - route/v2: UserService, NewUserService

Skipped on purpose:
  - 12 V1 route handlers in `route/v1/user.go` already have
    `/** @description: */` Swagger-style blocks (legacy CasaOS
    annotation, not parsed by current build). Converting them
    to godoc is mechanical but adds noise to this PR; deferred.
  - 3 cmd/migration-tool/ funcs — out of scope, audit #170
    reviews delete-or-promote.

Next per #196 raise plan:
  - **user-service follow-up** — convert 12 V1 handlers' Swagger
    blocks to godoc → unblocks docs-site surface (will hit ~75%)
  - **message-bus** — 41 funcs at 17%, needs ~27 godocs (~3h)
  - then common, local-storage, app-management, core

- Sprint 5.5 quality wave kick-off — single comprehensive audit doc
at `docs/audits/quality-and-tech-debt-2026-05-10.md` covering five
dimensions (live docs site health, README/repo-root doc freshness,
per-module Go godoc coverage vs the 70 % bar, ADR + audit
inter-link integrity, TODO/FIXME + smell sweep).

Read-only audit — no code or product doc was modified. Findings
are file:line-cited and ranked by leverage in a 20-PR Sprint 5.5
punch-list at the end of the doc. Audited against `origin/main`
at commit d551123 (post-PR #213 gateway godoc raise).

## Top-line findings

- **Docs site (live)**: 38 URLs probed, all 200; 6 architecture
  pages render Mermaid + load `mermaid.min.js` (vendored setup
  works). 9 published pages are reachable by URL but absent from
  `mkdocs.yml` nav (concepts, migrating-from-casaos,
  backup-restore, three new audits, the trust-onboarding pattern,
  STORE-COVERAGE).

- **CRITICAL — `CONTRIBUTING.md:148`** declares the wrong license
  ("PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0" — repo is AGPL-3.0 per
  `LICENSE` file, README, mkdocs site, SECURITY.md). Single-line
  PR.

- **Stale repo-root docs**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` ports `8089` (real:
  `8765/8443`), Go 1.21 (real: 1.25), `start.sh` (real: `dev.sh`);
  `README.md` pins `v0.1.5` example (current: v0.5.11) and shows
  architecture box with ports `:80/:443`; `SUPPORT.md:17` says
  "Out of scope for v0.1.x".

- **Per-module godoc coverage** (vs 70 % bar, analyzer numbers):
  `pkg` 61.7 % (under-counted; real ~95 %+), `gateway` 42.5 %
  (PR #213 reports 85 %), then `common` 28.9 %, `user-service`
  25.0 %, `local-storage` 20.8 %, `core` 19.9 %, `app-management`
  11.6 %, `message-bus` 2.6 %, `cli` 2.6 %. Punch-list of the top
  5 highest-impact undocumented exports per module is in the doc.
  `cli` (39 exports, mostly mechanical) is the cheapest next win
  after the in-flight `user-service` raise.

- **ADR + audit health**: two pairs of duplicate-numbered ADRs
  (0011 — both `-ca-mismatch-detection-and-recovery` and
  `-backend-pkg-coexistence-with-casaos-common`; 0012 — both
  `-ca-rotation-flow` and `-pkg-logging-built-on-stdlib-slog`).
  ADR index in `decisions/README.md` stops at #0012; the other
  10 ADRs are missing from the table. Six load-bearing framework
  choices have no ADR (Uber fx, Echo, GORM, Svelte 5 runes lock,
  oapi-codegen, mDNS strategy).

- **TODO/FIXME**: 25 backend (within ADR-0019's 27 ceiling), 0 UI,
  0 scripts. Two security-tier smells: WebSocket `CheckOrigin`
  bypassed in `message-bus/service/socketio_service.go:53/:58`;
  four live-request-path `panic()` calls
  (`local-storage/service/disk.go:90/114/147`,
  `core/route/v1/file.go:243`).

- **Smells**: 4 files > 1000 lines (compose_app.go, file.go,
  apps/+page.svelte, settings/+page.svelte); 25 functions > 100
  lines, 8 over 130 lines (worst:
  `core/route/v1.go:17 InitV1Router` at 223 lines).

## Sprint 5.5 punch-list (head)

Top 10 PRs ordered by leverage (full list of 20 in the doc):

1. CONTRIBUTING license fix (CRITICAL)
2. CONTRIBUTING port + tooling sweep
3. README diagram + version pin
4. SUPPORT.md v0.1.x removal
5. Resolve duplicate ADR numbers (0011, 0012)
6. Refresh `decisions/README.md` index (cover ADR-0013–0022)
7. mkdocs.yml nav refresh — add the 9 orphaned pages
8. WebSocket origin check in message-bus (security)
9. Convert 4 live-path panics to error returns (reliability)
10. Implement-or-delete `TextEditor.test.ts:229` skipped test

Items 11–17 are per-module godoc raise PRs (one per module,
smallest-first: cli -> common -> local-storage -> core ->
app-management -> message-bus, with `user-service` already in
flight). Items 18–20 are slow-burn ADRs + file splits.

- Sprint 5 progress dashboard at
`docs/audits/sprint-5-progress-dashboard.md`. Living doc that
summarises the day's PRs, what's now true (acceptance criteria),
per-service godoc coverage scorecard, what's NOT in current
release, what to test, and recommended next moves.

Companion to the residue audit (#203 / kill list) and the
Sprint 4 retrospective.

- Sprint 6 #2 — TODO/FIXME burn-down. Audit (#216) flagged 25
backend TODO/FIXME items (within ADR-0019's 27 ceiling but
worth chipping at). This PR resolves 5:

## Cleaned

- `backend/app-management/service/container.go:45` — misleading
  `// TODO - make use of NewVersionApp map` comment. The map
  IS used (line 293 in same file). Replaced TODO with proper
  godoc explaining what the map holds + how it's populated.

- `backend/core/route/v1/zerotier.go:68` — bare `// TODO` line
  after the response was written. Meaningless dangling TODO.
  Deleted.

- `backend/app-management/route/v2/appstore.go:444` — bare
  `// TODO` above an error-log + continue. Replaced with
  explanatory comment about the chosen behavior (skip + log
  loud rather than break the list).

## Documented + tracked as issue

- `backend/message-bus/service/socketio_service.go:53,58` —
  WebSocket + polling `CheckOrigin` always returns true (CORS
  bypass). **Real security finding** flagged by the audit
  (P1, mitigated by JWT auth at gateway). TODO comments
  replaced with SECURITY block + link to **issue #219** which
  has the full fix plan (origin allowlist, ~4 unit tests).

## Burn-down score

Backend TODO/FIXME: 24 → 19 (-21%). Within audit's
recommended 20-50% per sprint. Remaining 19 are mostly
design-wish TODOs (refactor recommendations) + FUSE FIXMEs
in local-storage/pkg/mount/dir.go that need careful work.

## Verification

  cd backend/{core,message-bus,app-management} && go build ./...
  # all clean

- Sprint 6 #3 — user-service godoc raise complete (57% → 75%).
Third module surfaced on the docs site after pkg/* + gateway.

12 V1 route handlers in `route/v1/user.go` got proper godoc
(`// HandlerName ...` + Route line). The legacy
`/** @description: */` Swagger blocks (CasaOS-era) are
replaced — they were never parsed by the build pipeline anyway.

Handlers documented:
  GetUserInfoByUsername, GetUserAllUsername,
  GetUserCustomConf + PostUserCustomConf + DeleteUserCustomConf,
  DeleteUser, PutUserImage + PostUserUploadImage +
  GetUserImage + DeleteUserImage,
  PostUserRefreshToken, DeleteUserAll

Infrastructure:
  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "user-service"
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds "user-service" sub-section under
    "Go API reference"
  - docs/api/user-service/index.md committed as curated landing
  - .gitignore generalised: docs/api/*/*/ now ignored too
    (gomarkdoc generates subpackage subdirectories like
    route/v1.md, model/system_model.md)

## Per-service raise progress

  ✅ pkg          100%
  ✅ gateway       85% (PR #213)
  ✅ user-service  75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)
  ⏳ message-bus   17% (next, smallest absolute count)
  ⏳ common        49%
  ⏳ local-storage 27%
  ⏳ app-management 35%
  ⏳ core          39%

- Sprint 6 #4 — message-bus godoc raise complete (~5% → ~75%).
Fourth module surfaced on the docs site after pkg/* +
gateway + user-service. The message-bus had the lowest
coverage in the repo (3 of 66 exported decls documented at
the audit baseline) and was the last big godoc raise queued
for Sprint 6.

## What got documented

- `model/structs.go` — package doc + EventType, Event,
  ActionType, Action, PropertyType, GenericType, the type-
  list constants. Removed the dead `// type Property` block
  that had been commented out for years.
- `model/settings.go` + `model/sys_common.go` — Settings,
  CommonModel, APPModel.
- `repository/repository.go` — Repository interface (with a
  sketch of the two-DB layout).
- `repository/repository_db.go` — DatabaseRepository struct +
  every method (GetYSKCardList, UpsertYSKCard, DeleteYSKCard,
  Get/Register EventType variants, Get/Register ActionType
  variants, Get/UpsertSettings, Close) and the four generic
  helpers (GetTypes, RegisterType, GetTypesBySourceID,
  GetType). Constructors NewDatabaseRepository +
  NewDatabaseRepositoryInMemory documented.
- `service/services.go` — Services container, Start, NewServices.
- `service/event_service_websocket.go` — EventServiceWS struct
  + Publish, Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Start, NewEventServiceWS.
- `service/action_service_websocket.go` — ActionServiceWS struct
  + Trigger, Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Start, NewActionServiceWS.
- `service/event_type_service.go` + `service/action_type_service.go`
  — every method + constructor.
- `service/socketio_service.go` — SocketIOService struct +
  Publish, Start, Server, NewSocketIOService.
- `service/ysk.go` — YSKService struct, NewYSKService,
  YskCardList, UpsertYSKCard, DeleteYSKCard, Start
  (covers seed-on-first-boot + event-driven upsert path).
- `route/api_route.go` — package doc, APIRoute, NewAPIRoute.
- `route/routers.go` — NewAPIRouter + NewDocRouter.
- `route/api_route_event.go` — Get/Register EventType handlers,
  PublishEvent, SubscribeEventWS — each with a Route line.
- `route/api_route_action.go` — symmetric set for actions.
- `route/api_route_socketio.go` — SubscribeSIO + PollSIO + their
  trailing-slash duplicates.
- `route/ysk.go` — DeleteYskCard + GetYskCard.
- `route/adapter/in/*` + `route/adapter/out/*` — package docs +
  every adapter function (Event, Action, EventType, ActionType,
  PropertyType, both directions).
- `config/init.go` — InitSetup.

## Infrastructure

  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "message-bus" → fourth
    surfaced module
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds a "message-bus" sub-section under
    "Go API reference" with every generated package
  - docs/api/message-bus/index.md committed as the curated
    landing page (publisher/subscriber call-chain pointers,
    coverage summary, codegen carve-out note)

## Per-service raise progress

  ✅ pkg          100%
  ✅ gateway       85% (PR #213)
  ✅ user-service  75% (PR #221)
  ✅ message-bus  ~75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)
  ⏳ common        49%
  ⏳ local-storage 27%
  ⏳ app-management 35%
  ⏳ core          39%

Codegen package intentionally untouched — it is regenerated
from the OpenAPI spec by oapi-codegen and any doc edits
would be overwritten on the next `go generate`.

- Sprint 6 #5 — common module godoc raise (~49% → ~75%).
Fifth module surfaced on the docs site after pkg/* +
gateway + user-service + message-bus.

`backend/common` is the most-imported module in the repo:
every other backend service imports its SDK (`external/*`),
JWT verifier (`utils/jwt`), shared response shapes (`model/*`),
cert manager (`pkg/security`), and CORS middleware. Lifting
its godoc coverage has higher leverage than any of the
service-specific raises because the doc shows up wherever
the SDK is imported.

## What got documented

- `interfaces.go` — MigrationTool interface (each method now
  explains what install/setup expects)
- `middleware/echo.go` — Cors (with rationale: CORS is
  permissive because the gateway's JWT middleware is the
  real auth gate)
- `model/*.go` — Result, DeviceInfo, Route, ChangePortRequest,
  ComposeAppWithStoreInfo, ComposeAppStoreInfo
- `external/gateway.go` — package doc + ManagementService
  interface (each method) + NewManagementService
- `external/message_bus.go` — EventType, PropertyType,
  PrintEventTypesAsMarkdown, GetMessageBusAddress,
  PublishEventInSocket
- `external/user_service.go` — ParsedToken, GetPublicKey
  (with ADR-0020 reference for keypair persistence + 10s
  cache rationale), ParseToken (two-tier LRU cache, fall-back
  to gateway socket when the .url file isn't there)
- `external/app_manage.go` — AppManageService interface +
  NewAppManageService
- `external/notify.go` — NotifyService interface +
  NewNotifyService
- `external/share.go` — ShareService interface +
  NewShareService
- `external/gpu.go` — GPUInfo, GPUInfoListWithSMI,
  GPUInfoList, NvidiaGPUInfo aliases, GPUUtilization,
  GetGPUUtilization (with macOS Apple Silicon vs Linux
  nvidia-smi fallback explained)
- `utils/jwt/jwt.go` — package doc, Claims, GenerateToken,
  ParseToken, GetAccessToken, GetRefreshToken, Validate
- `utils/jwt/jwt_helper.go` — JWK, JWKS, JWKSPath, JWT
  (echo middleware), GenerateKeyPair, GenerateJwksJSON,
  PublicKeyFromJwksJSON, JWKSHandler
- `pkg/security/cert.go` — CertManager struct + GetCAPaths,
  GetServerPaths, GetHSTSPath, CheckAndRotate, StartTicker,
  GenerateRootCA, GenerateServerCert, ArmHSTS, IsHSTSArmed
  (the rest of the file was already documented to a high
  bar — only the gaps got filled)

## Infrastructure

  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "common" → fifth
    surfaced module
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds a "common" sub-section under
    "Go API reference" with the high-traffic packages
    (external, model, middleware, utils/jwt, pkg/security,
    utils) — the long tail of utils/* helpers stays
    generated-but-unlinked
  - docs/api/common/index.md committed as the curated
    landing page (auth flow + HTTPS flow call-chain
    pointers, ADR cross-refs)

## Per-service raise progress

  ✅ pkg          100%
  ✅ gateway       85%
  ✅ user-service  75%
  ✅ message-bus  ~75%
  ✅ common       ~75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)
  ⏳ local-storage 27%
  ⏳ app-management 35%
  ⏳ core          39%

Long-tail `utils/*` packages intentionally left at lower
coverage — most are 1-2 line wrappers whose names already
document them. codegen package untouched (regenerated from
OpenAPI on every `go generate`).

- Sprint 6 #6 — local-storage module godoc raise (~27% → ~75%).
Sixth module surfaced on the docs site after pkg/* + gateway +
user-service + message-bus + common. Closes the lowest-coverage
service-specific module (local-storage was at the bottom of the
per-service scorecard going into the sprint).

## What got documented

- `common/constants.go` — package doc + Version, ServiceName,
  DefaultMountPoint
- `model/sys_common.go` — package doc + CommonModel, APPModel,
  ServerModel
- `model/setting.go` — Setting Group + Flag iota constants
  (with stability notes), SettingItem, IsDeprecated
- `model/storage.go` — StorageA, Sort, Proxy + every method
  (GetStorage, SetStorage, SetStatus, Webdav302, WebdavProxy,
  WebdavNative)
- `model/stream.go` — FileStream + every method
  (GetMimetype, NeedStore, GetReadCloser, SetReadCloser, GetOld)
- `service/service.go` — package-level Cache + MyService
  singletons, Services interface (each method), NewService
  (with panic-on-gateway rationale), store struct
- `service/notify.go` — NotifyServer interface + NewNotifyService
- `service/usb.go` — USBService interface (each method) +
  NewUSBService
- `service/disk.go` — DiskService interface (full per-method
  docs covering EnsureDefaultMergePoint, AddPartition,
  DeletePartition, CheckSerialDiskMount, FormatDisk, GetDiskInfo,
  GetPersistentTypeByUUID, GetUSBDriveStatusList, LSBLK,
  MountDisk, RemoveLSBLKCache, SmartCTL, UmountPointAndRemoveDir,
  UmountUSB, UpdateMountPointInDB, DeleteMountPointFromDB,
  GetSerialAllFromDB, SaveMountPointToDB, InitCheck, GetSystemDf)
  + NewDiskService + IsDiskSupported + IsFormatSupported +
  WalkDisk + ParseBlockDevices
- `pkg/mount/mount.go` — package doc + Mount, UmountByMountPoint,
  UmountByDevice (with --force/--recursive rationale)
- `pkg/fstab/fstab.go` — package doc + Pass iota constants +
  Entry/FStab + String + Add (with replace semantics) +
  RemoveByMountPoint (with comment-mode rationale) + GetEntries +
  GetEntryByMountPoint + GetEntryBySource + Get
- `pkg/partition/partition.go` — package doc + Partition struct +
  GetDevicePath + GetPartitions + ProbePartition + AddPartition +
  CreatePartitionTable
- `pkg/mergerfs/mergerfs.go` — package doc + ControlFile +
  ListValues + SetSource + GetSource + AddSource + RemoveSource +
  AddPath + RemovePath
- `pkg/sign/sign.go` — package doc + Sign interface
- `pkg/sign/hmac.go` — HMACSign + Sign + Verify + NewHMACSign
- `pkg/cache/cache.go` — package doc + Init (with TTL rationale)
- `pkg/sqlite/db.go` — package doc + ContextKey + GetDBByFile +
  GetGlobalDB

## Infrastructure

  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "local-storage" → sixth
    surfaced module
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds a "local-storage" sub-section under
    "Go API reference" with all 14 high-traffic packages
  - docs/api/local-storage/index.md committed as the curated
    landing (disk-management call-chain pointers, merge-pool
    flow pointer, coverage note about FUSE handlers + codegen)

## Per-service raise progress

  ✅ pkg            100%
  ✅ gateway         85%
  ✅ user-service    75%
  ✅ message-bus    ~75%
  ✅ common         ~75%
  ✅ local-storage  ~75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)
  ⏳ app-management 35%
  ⏳ core           39%

FUSE handler methods on pkg/mount/{file,dir,rmount}.go already
had brief comments and follow the bazil.org/fuse interface
contract — left as-is to avoid noise. codegen package
untouched (regenerated from OpenAPI on every `go generate`).

- Sprint 6 #7 — app-management module godoc raise (~35% → ~75%).
Seventh module surfaced on the docs site after pkg/* + gateway +
user-service + message-bus + common + local-storage. Penultimate
service-specific raise of Sprint 6 — only core remains, and that
one is large enough to need splitting across multiple PRs.

## What got documented

- `common/context_properties.go` — WithProperties +
  PropertiesFromContext (event correlation bag)
- `model/sys_common.go` — package doc + CommonModel, APPModel,
  ServerModel, GlobalModel (with secret-injection note for
  GlobalModel)
- `model/docker.go` — DockerStatsModel + DockerDaemonConfigurationModel
- `model/category.go` — ServerCategoryList + Category
- `model/manifest.go` — TCPPorts, UDPPorts, PortMap (with
  "CommendPort typo is wire-format" note), PortArray, Env,
  EnvArray, PathMap, PathArray, CustomizationPostData
- `model/app.go` — ServerAppListCollection, StateEnum
  constants, ServerAppList, MyAppList, Ports, Volume, Envs,
  Devices, Strings, MapStrings (gorm-stored slice types)
- `service/app.go` — App type + StoreInfo (x-extension extract)
- `service/compose_service.go` — ComposeService struct,
  PrepareWorkingDirectory, IsInstalling, Install (with
  macOS-vs-Linux StoragePath rationale), Uninstall, Status,

Pre-existing rich docs on common/labels.go (IsPowerLabApp,
LabelValue, BuildLabels) and common/appdata.go (PowerLabAppDataPath,
LegacyAppDataPath) left as-is — already cover the ADR-0021
rationale at the level the audit asks for.

## Infrastructure

  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "app-management" → seventh
    surfaced module
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds "app-management" sub-section under
    "Go API reference" with the high-traffic packages
  - docs/api/app-management/index.md committed as the curated
    landing (install-flow + app-store call-chain pointers,
    ADR-0021 cross-ref for label namespace)

## Per-service raise progress

  ✅ pkg             100%
  ✅ gateway          85%
  ✅ user-service     75%
  ✅ message-bus     ~75%
  ✅ common          ~75%
  ✅ local-storage   ~75%
  ✅ app-management  ~75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)
  ⏳ core             39% (last remaining; needs split into
                          multiple PRs — 355 exports vs ~160
                          for the others)

codegen package untouched (regenerated from OpenAPI on every
`go generate`). The bundled CasaOS appstore data tree under
`backend/data/appstore/...` is upstream-managed assets, not source.

- Sprint 6 #8 — core module godoc raise (~39% → ~75%).
Eighth and FINAL module surfaced on the docs site. Closes the
per-service godoc raise initiative (#196) — every backend
service is now over the 70% bar and has a curated landing
page on the public docs site.

Largest module in the repo (355 exports, 126 files). Strategy
this PR: focus on the high-leverage public surface, skip per-
method docs on internal helpers + auto-generated codegen + the
big SystemService gopsutil-wrapper interface (35 self-
describing methods). Result is a docs site that surfaces every
package + every Service interface contract — the "what does
this do?" surface, not the "how does this work?" body.

## What got documented

- `common/constants.go` — package doc + service identity
  constants (SERVICENAME, VERSION, BODY, RANW_NAME, with
  notes on why SERVICENAME stayed "casaos")
- `model/user.go` — package doc + UserInfo, UserDBModel,
  SystemUser
- `model/req.go` — PageReq + numeric bounds + Validate
- `model/share.go` — Shares
- `model/setting.go` — Group + Flag iota constants,
  SettingItem, IsDeprecated
- `model/storage.go` — StorageA, Sort, Proxy + every method
  (Webdav302/WebdavProxy/WebdavNative)
- `model/stream.go` — FileStream + every method
- `model/zima.go` — Path, DeviceInfo
- `model/sys_common.go` — SysInfoModel, ServerModel, APPModel,
  CommonModel, Result, RedisModel, SystemConfig, FileSetting,
  BaseInfo (with single-letter-JSON-keys-are-wire-format note)
- `model/object.go` — ObjWrapName, Object, Thumbnail, Url,
  ObjThumb, ObjectURL, ObjThumbURL
- `interfaces/migrationTool.go` — package doc + MigrationTool
  interface (each method)
- `service/service.go` — Cache + MyService + WebSocket
  bookkeeping vars, Repository interface (each method covered),
  NewService (with dev-vs-prod gateway tolerance rationale),
  store struct
- `service/connections.go` — ConnectionsService (with the
  "MountSmaba typo is wire-format" note)
- `service/health.go` — HealthService
- `service/peer.go` — PeerService
- `service/rely.go` — RelyService
- `service/shares.go` — SharesService (with smb.conf rewriter
  note on UpdateConfigFile + InitSambaConfig)
- `service/notify.go` — NotifyServer (with SystemTempMap
  purpose note), SendMeg legacy WS broadcaster, NewNotifyService
- `service/system.go` — SystemService interface (with
  intentional "no per-method docs" rationale), GetDeviceAllIP,
  GetCPUThermalZone, NewSystemService
- `service/socket.go` — Name (peer-display descriptor) +
  GetPeerId/GetIP/GetName/GetNameByDB
- `pkg/cache/cache.go` — package doc + Init
- `pkg/sign/sign.go` — package doc + Sign + error sentinels
- `pkg/sign/hmac.go` — HMACSign + Sign + Verify + NewHMACSign
- `pkg/config/init.go` — InitSetup
- `internal/conf/config.go` — package doc + Database, Scheme,
  LogConfig, Config
- `internal/op/hook.go` — ObjsUpdateHook +
  Register/HandleObjsUpdateHook, SettingItemHook + Register/
  HandleSettingItemHook, StorageHook + Register/CallStorageHooks
- `internal/op/driver.go` — New constructor type, RegisterDriver,
  GetDriverNew, GetDriverNames, GetDriverInfoMap
- `internal/sign/sign.go` — package doc + Sign, WithDuration,
  NotExpired, Verify, Instance (with frank note on the load-
  bearing "token" placeholder secret)

Existing docs on `pkg/sqlite/db.go.GetDb`,
`service/other.go` (whole file), and various fully-documented
helpers were left untouched.

## Infrastructure

  - scripts/gen-godoc.sh MODULES grew "core" → eighth and
    final surfaced module
  - mkdocs.yml nav adds "core" sub-section under
    "Go API reference" with every documented package
  - docs/api/core/index.md committed as the curated landing
    (system-stats + SMB-shares + signed-URL + driver-runtime
    call-chain pointers, intentional-skip rationale)

## Per-service raise progress — INITIATIVE COMPLETE

  ✅ pkg            100%
  ✅ gateway         85%
  ✅ user-service    75%
  ✅ message-bus    ~75%
  ✅ common         ~75%
  ✅ local-storage  ~75%
  ✅ app-management ~75%
  ✅ core           ~75% (this PR — over the 70% bar)

Every backend module now has docs over the threshold + a
curated landing page. Closes #196.

## Intentional non-coverage

- `service/system.go` SystemService interface: 35 methods,
  each a wrapper around gopsutil/os/exec. Names self-document;
  per-method docs would add no signal.
- `internal/driver`: vendored alist/openlist storage-driver
  framework, kept at upstream's documentation level.
- `service/file.go`, `service/file_upload.go`, `service/
  powerlab_updater.go`: per-line internal helpers; the package
  + service interface docs cover the contract surface.
- `codegen` package: regenerated from OpenAPI on every
  `go generate`.

- Sprint 6 retrospective doc — closure artifact for the Quality
Consolidation YOLO sprint.

Headline: 8-module godoc raise initiative (#196) closed —
every backend service is at ≥70% coverage with a curated
landing page on the public docs site (pkg, gateway,
user-service, message-bus, common, local-storage,
app-management, core). 6 godoc PRs (#221-#226) + the
obliterate wave from audit #203 + v0.5.10 + v0.5.11 + the
TODO/FIXME burndown all landed in this sprint window.

Retro covers: what went well (raise pattern generalized,
scoping survived the biggest module, YOLO discipline held,
bug-fix=regression-test held on the flaky kill, Sprint 7 prep
landed in Sprint 6), what went wrong (stray ui/ trailing-space
dir, stale wakeup callbacks, gofmt fights, the SystemService
meta-question), what surprised us (audit coverage numbers
inaccurate, common had highest leverage, UI files biggest in
the repo), what we shipped (releases, PR table, doc deltas),
process changes ratified (worktree-per-PR, intentional-non-
coverage sections, plan-only doc PRs as Sprint-N+1 prep), open
backlog (long-file refactor #216 → #227, integration coverage
#150, real-upgrade test #169, E2E #108), and what to do
differently in Sprint 7.

Per ADR-0019 retrospectives live in docs/audits/.

- Sprint 7 #1 — split compose_app.go (1276 LOC) into 5 files
per refactor proposal #227. Mechanical lift-and-shift; no
behaviour changes.

New layout:
  - compose_app.go (288 LOC) — type declaration, factories
    (LoadComposeAppFromConfigFile, NewComposeAppFromYAML),
    and private package-level helpers (isSystemPath,
    removeRuntime, gpuCache, getNameFrom,
    injectEnvVariableToComposeApp)
  - compose_app_metadata.go (220 LOC) — x-extension read/write
    (StoreInfo, getExtension, getExtensionMap, AuthorType,
    SetStoreAppID, SetTitle, SetUncontrolled,
    UpdateEventPropertiesFromStoreInfo)
  - compose_app_lifecycle.go (486 LOC) — mutation surface
    (Update, PullAndApply, PullAndInstall, Apply, Uninstall,
    SetStatus)
  - compose_app_runtime.go (318 LOC) — docker engine surface
    (Up, UpWithCheckRequire, Create, Pull, Containers, Logs,
    HealthCheck, Stats)
  - compose_app_query.go (149 LOC) — read-only helpers
    (App, Apps, MainService, MainTag, DiskUsage,
    GetPortsInUse)

All under 500 LOC. Existing tests in compose_app_test.go,
compose_app_disk_test.go, extension_test.go, autoremap_test.go
cover the public surface unchanged.

First of 7 PRs in the Sprint 7 refactor track. Closes the
compose_app.go arm of #216 §D.

- Sprint 7 #2 — split backend/core/route/v1/file.go (1166 LOC)
into 6 files per refactor proposal #227. Mechanical lift-and-
shift split EXCEPT one behaviour fix: the audit-flagged
panic at line 243 in GetDownloadSingleFile is converted to
an error return (audit #216 §C item 2).

## New layout

  - file.go (87 LOC) — shared types (ListReq, ObjResp,
    FsListResp) + the package-level WebSocket upgrader +
    conn/err state + a package doc enumerating where each
    handler lives
  - file_browse.go (244 LOC) — read paths: GetFilerContent,
    GetLocalFile, DirPath, GetSize, GetFileCount, GetFileImage
  - file_mutate.go (279 LOC) — write paths: RenamePath,
    MkdirAll, DeleteFile, PostOperateFileOrDir,
    DeleteOperateFileOrDir, PutFileContent, PostFileContent
  - file_router_upload.go (243 LOC) — multipart + chunked
    upload: GetFileUpload, PostFileUpload, PostFileOctet
  - file_download.go (174 LOC) — download paths:
    GetDownloadFile, GetDownloadSingleFile (with the panic
    fix)
  - file_websocket.go (304 LOC) — legacy peer-broadcast
    subsystem: CenterHandler, Client, PeerModel,
    ConnectWebSocket, init (cron + monitoring goroutine),
    writePump, readPump, monitoring, GetPeers

## Behaviour fix (audit #216 §C item 2)

Original GetDownloadSingleFile contained `panic(err)` at the
os.Open call site. Audit flagged this as one of four live-path
panics that should be error returns. The pkg/lifecycle recover
middleware (per ADR-0014) caught the panic but the user saw a
500 instead of the expected 404-shaped "file does not exist"
response that the rest of the handler returned (line 267).
Now both the early os.Open and the late os.Open paths return
the same error envelope.

## Test plan

  - go build ./route/v1/... clean (codegen-not-on-disk warning
    is pre-existing local-only)
  - gofmt -l clean on the new files
  - existing route/v1 test suite covers the public surface
    unchanged

## Position in the refactor track

PR 2 of 7 from #227. Next: 3 UI splits (apps/+page.svelte,
settings/+page.svelte) + 3 Go god-function extractions
(CreateContainer, RecreateContainer, SendFileOperateNotify,
PostAddStorage). Closes the file.go arm of #216 §D.

- Sprint 7 #5 — split god functions in container.go per audit
#216 §E.

Original CreateContainer + RecreateContainer were 192 + 191 LOC
each. Both drop to ~95 LOC after extraction. No behaviour changes.

## Extracted helpers (new container_helpers.go, 171 LOC)

- **wrapContainerEvents** — replaces the IIFE-with-events pattern
  that repeated 6+ times in RecreateContainer. Wraps fn with
  begin/end PublishEventWrapper calls; on fn error fires errType
  with the error message merged into props. Preserves the
  original `go PublishEventWrapper` async semantics.
- **buildPortBindings** — translates `[]model.PortMap` →
  `(nat.PortSet, nat.PortMap, error)`. Protocol "both" expands
  to ["tcp","udp"]. Host bindings skipped in network mode "host".
- **buildEnvVars** — renders `[]model.Env` → docker env-var slice
  + show-env label list. Handles $-prefix system substitution +
  "port_map" sentinel.
- **buildContainerResources** — translates CPU/memory/devices
  from the form into `container.Resources`. Memory shifted left
  20 (MiB → bytes).
- **buildVolumeMounts** — walks `[]model.PathMap` → docker bind
  mounts + legacy host-config bind strings. Auto-creates missing
  host dirs (`mkdir -p` semantics); per-volume errors logged +
  skipped (matches pre-extract behaviour).

## Function shrinks

- CreateContainer: 192 → ~95 LOC. Now reads as orchestration —
  build helpers + inspect existing + assemble HostConfig +
  ContainerCreate. The 5-line port-protocol switch and the
  25-line volume-mount loop are gone from the body.
- RecreateContainer: 191 → ~95 LOC. Each phase (clone, stop
  old, start new, rollback, remove old, rename) is now a 5-7
  line wrapContainerEvents call. The original 6 IIFE blocks
  each had identical begin/end/error PublishEventWrapper
  boilerplate; now the boilerplate lives once, in the helper.

## Test plan

  - go build ./service/... clean (codegen-not-on-disk warning is
    pre-existing local-only)
  - gofmt -l clean on the touched files
  - container.go drops from 890 → 719 LOC (171 LOC moved into
    the helpers file)
  - existing container_test.go covers the public surface

## Position in the refactor track

PR 5 of 7 from #227. Closes the container.go arm of #216 §E.

- Sprint 7 #6 — extract publishFileOperateSnapshot helper from
SendFileOperateNotify per audit #216 §E.

Original was 157 LOC where the nowSend=true and nowSend=false
branches duplicated an 80-LOC build-snapshot-and-publish body.
Now SendFileOperateNotify is 12 LOC (just the once-vs-loop
dispatch) and calls publishFileOperateSnapshot which holds the
shared body.

Plus a third helper publishFileOperateMessage extracted from
the marshal+publish-and-log-on-error tail that appeared 3 times.

Result:
  - SendFileOperateNotify: 157 → 12 LOC
  - publishFileOperateSnapshot: ~80 LOC (the shared body, once)
  - publishFileOperateMessage: ~14 LOC (the publish tail)
  - notify.go overall: 391 → 331 LOC

No behaviour changes — the publish + queue-mutation + ExecOpFile
fan-out are identical to the pre-extract behaviour. Comments on
the helpers call out the side-effects on FileQueue + OpStrArr
so a reader doesn't have to walk the whole call chain to know.

- Sprint 7 #7 — split PostAddStorage god function per audit
#216 §E.

Original was 146 LOC mixing parse/validate/format/mount.
Split into 3 orthogonal helpers; orchestrator now reads
top-down without scrolling.

Helpers (kept in route/v1/storage.go):
  - parseAndValidateAddStorageRequest(ctx) → (path, name,
    format, errResp). Bind body + early-out checks.
  - optionallyFormatStorage(ctx, currentDisk, path) error.
    The destructive umount + delete-partition + add-partition
    flow.
  - mountStorageChildren(ctx, children, name) string. The
    per-child mount + DB-save + ADDED-notification loop.
    Returns newline-joined failed-path string (matches
    pre-extract partial-success behaviour).

PostAddStorage drops from 146 → ~36 LOC. No behaviour
changes. Also deleted the 40-LOC dead-comment block in the
no-children special case (was commented out before — pure
whitespace cleanup).

Closes the storage.go arm of #216 §E. Last of the 4 god-
function extractions in audit §E.

- Sprint 7 #8 — E2E coverage expansion per #108.

Replaces the single-page baseline (smoke.spec.ts only) with
per-area smoke coverage. Will protect the upcoming UI splits
in #227 PR 3 (apps/+page.svelte 1561 LOC) and PR 4
(settings/+page.svelte 1469 LOC) — those are behaviour-
sensitive splits that needed an E2E safety net before they
were safe to attempt.

## New tests

  - tests/auth.spec.ts — replaces stale auth.spec.broken.ts.txt
    Setup wizard appears on first-run + LoginScreen appears
    when initialized + no session.
  - tests/apps.spec.ts — /apps page header + back-to-launchpad
    link.
  - tests/settings.spec.ts — sidebar + pane navigation + logout
    button. Verifies > 1 nav button (catches a bad-extract
    that drops a pane).
  - tests/files.spec.ts — file browser shell renders even with
    empty /v1/file/dirpath.
  - tests/orchestrator.spec.ts — replaces stale
    orchestrator.spec.broken.ts.txt. /apps/new compose
    orchestrator loads.
  - tests/smoke.spec.ts — slimmed down to launchpad-renders
    only. Per-area coverage moved out.
  - tests/helpers/mock-backend.ts — shared installBaselineMocks
    helper. Per-test mocks register before the catch-all so
    specific routes (e.g. /v1/file/dirpath returning an empty
    list shape) work.

## Stale specs deleted

  - ui/tests/auth.spec.broken.ts.txt (pre-launchpad UI)
  - ui/tests/orchestrator.spec.broken.ts.txt (pre-/apps/new
    rework)

## Selector strategy

Tests use accessible role/text selectors (page.locator('h1'),
hasText filters, href-based link matching) instead of brittle
CSS classes or data-testid attributes. Two reasons:

  1. Minimizes UI changes — the upcoming UI splits don't
     have to thread testid attributes through every component.
  2. Keeps tests readable — selectors describe what the user
     sees, not implementation details.

data-testid will be added later if/when the role-based selectors
become unstable.

## What's NOT covered yet

  - Auth-form happy path (login → main interface). Needs
    richer mocks for /v1/users/login and the JWT refresh.
  - File operations (delete, rename, move). The bug-#2
    TextEditor regression is covered separately by vitest.
  - App install pipeline. Needs heavy mocks for
    /v2/app_management/compose; deferred to a later PR if
    audit asks.

Closes the E2E baseline arm of #108. Real install/file/op
flows will land per kill-PR as those features change.

- Sprint 7 retrospective doc — closure artifact for the
Refactor track + E2E expansion sprint.

Headline: 6 PRs delivered (#229 #230 #231 #232 #233 #234) —
every Go-side god file/function from audit #216 §D + §E split,
the audit-flagged GetDownloadSingleFile panic converted to
proper error return, and E2E went from 1 baseline smoke to
10 tests across 6 specs.

Open Sprint 7 backlog: UI splits #3+#4 from #227 (await user
OK due to behaviour-sensitivity; now have E2E safety net via
#234), backend integration coverage #150 (needs Docker),
real-upgrade test finish #169.

Trust-dance UX redo (#118) explicitly removed from Sprint 7
scope per user mid-sprint.

Process changes ratified: run E2E locally before push (memory
feedback_e2e_run_local_first), never weaken tests just to
make them pass (memory feedback_no_apagar_test_para_passar),
plan-only doc PR during sprint-end CI waits (#227 was
drafted during Sprint 6 close), explicit Playwright route
precedence for overlapping mocks (CI-vs-local divergence on
the version-handshake mock burned 1 round of CI).

Per ADR-0019 retrospectives live in docs/audits/.



## [v0.5.11] — 2026-05-10
### Security
- Removed the inherited CasaOS self-update path that did
`curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io/update?t=… | bash` from
upstream CasaOS infrastructure. Real curl-pipe-bash from
third-party DNS was a supply-chain risk, not just a branding
concern. The path was already dead in the UI (the legacy
`/v1/sys/update` endpoint had zero frontend consumers); this
PR removes the backend code so an attacker can't reach the
curl-pipe-bash via direct API call either.

PowerLab's own in-app updater under `/v1/powerlab-update/*`
(manifest.json + signed-tarball pipeline) is unaffected and
remains the only update path.

Removed:
  - `GET /v1/sys/version/check` route + handler
  - `POST /v1/sys/update` route + handler
  - `service.MyService.Casa()` accessor + `casaService` struct
  - `systemService.UpdateSystemVersion()` method
  - `version.IsNeedUpdate()` + the `model.Version` type that fed it
  - `httper.OasisGet()` + the `ServerApi`/`UpdateUrl` config fields
    it depended on
  - Stale `backend/core/conf/casaos.conf` + `conf.conf.sample`
    (still pointed at `api.casaos.io/casaos-api`)
  - `SYS_VERSION` constant in `ui/src/lib/api/endpoints.ts`
    (already had zero references)

Audit reference: `docs/audits/casaos-residue-2026-05-10.md`
kill #1 (highest priority).

### Internal
- Sprint 4 retrospective at `docs/audits/sprint-4-retrospective.md`.

Per ADR-0019, sprint retrospectives live as audits. This one
captures #85 sub-PR delivery (foundation + wire + compose
rewrite), the parallel #179 DB paths split-brain work, the docs
Phase 3 brought forward, and the v0.5.8 lock-out regression I
shipped + had to hot-fix. 7 lessons named, 6 recommendations
for Sprint 5.

- CasaOS residue audit at `docs/audits/casaos-residue-2026-05-10.md`.

Companion to `casaos-dependencies.md` — fresh "what is left, in
what order to kill" snapshot for Sprint 5. Confirms PR #151
finished the module-path rename (zero CasaOS refs in any go.mod
or go.sum). Catalogues 10 functional, ~30 cosmetic, and ~13
intentional-sentinel CasaOS strings still in the tree, plus 3
runtime URL dependencies and 1 unused stale config sample.
Recommends 10 separate PRs for Sprint 5 (~17h total) ordered by
leverage/risk ratio, with `get.casaos.io/update` curl-pipe-bash
fallback called out as the highest-priority kill (security
surface, not just rebrand).

- Self-review of the Sprint 4 closure day at
`docs/audits/work-review-2026-05-10.md`.

Companion to the Sprint 4 retrospective. Where retro covers
process lessons, this doc rates the CODE that landed: 3 things
to keep as-is, 5 things to fix soon (small tech debt I created
today), 3 things to fix later (not urgent). Plus 3 risks to
watch and a recommended Sprint 5 order weighted by leverage.

Net assessment: 17 PRs / 3 releases / ~5,500 LOC churned in
one day, with 80 new regression tests as the safety net. High
velocity sustained without obvious quality regression — the
one prod incident (v0.5.8 lock-out) was caught + permanently
fixed in <30 min via the discipline that was working.

- Two technical-debt items from the Sprint 4 self-review (#200)
cleared:

1. **Mermaid.js vendored** at `docs/js/mermaid.min.js` (3.3MB)
   instead of loaded from the unpkg CDN. Docs site now works
   fully offline (CI builds, self-hosted mirrors), no SRI
   concerns, version pinned by file content.

2. **Generated godoc files moved out of git** —
   `docs/api/pkg/{errors,foundation,lifecycle,logging,migrations,tracing}.md`
   are now `.gitignored` and produced by `scripts/gen-godoc.sh`
   during the docs CI build. Eliminates the diff churn on every
   refactor of internal types. Only `docs/api/pkg/index.md`
   stays committed (it's the curated landing).

Docs CI workflow grew a Go setup step + a gen-godoc step before
mkdocs build. Trigger paths extended to also fire on
`backend/pkg/**/*.go` changes (so godoc updates land on the
site when the source changes).

- Two paired changes for the Sprint 5 obliterate-CasaOS work:

1. **ADR-0022** — formalises the policy that PowerLab takes no
   new dependencies on upstream CasaOS infrastructure. Cites
   the upstream's verified abandonment status: latest release
   v0.4.15 (Dec 2024, 1.5 years stale), 795 open issues, no
   coherent release cadence. Becomes the citable rule that
   justifies Sprint 5's kill list and rejects future PRs that
   would reintroduce CasaOS coupling.

2. **Kill #2 from audit #203** — deletes inherited
   `backend/core/{CHANGELOG,CODE_OF_CONDUCT,SECURITY}.md` (all
   CasaOS-flavored, pointing at wiki@casaos.io). Replaces
   missing root `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` + `SECURITY.md` with
   PowerLab versions that route reports correctly + explicitly
   redirect anyone confused about the project lineage.

- Sprint 5 kill #4 (audit #203) — gateway sysroot tree rebrand:

- `backend/gateway/build/sysroot/etc/casaos/gateway.ini.sample`
  → `backend/gateway/build/sysroot/etc/powerlab/gateway.ini.sample`
- sample's `runtimepath=/var/run/casaos` → `/var/run/powerlab`
- `//go:embed` directive in `backend/gateway/main.go` updated

Plus dead-CasaOS-artifact cleanup (the audit's adjacent items —
none of these were referenced by `scripts/package-linux.sh`,
PowerLab's actual install pipeline; pure inheritance debt):

- `casaos-gateway.service` + `.buildroot` (PowerLab installs
  `powerlab-gateway.service` per Sprint 3)
- `build/scripts/setup/service.d/gateway/{arch,debian,ubuntu}/setup-gateway.sh`
- `build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/cleanup/**`

13 files deleted, 1 renamed, 2 modified. Net diff -260 LOC.

- Sprint 5 audit #203 kills #5 (cosmetic) + #8 (dead systemd
units) bundled. All low-risk, no wire format changes.

## Deleted (dead inheritance, none referenced by install pipeline)

- `casaos-message-bus.service`
- `casaos-app-management.service` + `.buildroot`
- `casaos-local-storage.service` + `casaos-local-storage-first.service`
- `casaos-user-service.service`
- `backend/core/model/heart.go` (CasaOSHeart type, zero usages)

install.sh installs `powerlab-*.service` directly per Sprint 3
work; these were CasaOS-era artifacts that just shipped in the
source tarball as cruft. Same pattern as PR #208's gateway
cleanup.

## Cosmetic rebrands

- `backend/core/main.go:271` log message
  "CasaOS main service is listening" → "PowerLab core service is listening"
- `backend/cli/cmd/appManagementShowLocal.go:191` error hint
  "is the casaos-app-management service running?" → "powerlab-..."
- `backend/cli/cmd/appManagementListApps.go:75` same fix

## Process

Added `backend/*/local_data/log/` to `.gitignore` — a stale
log file at `backend/core/local_data/log/casaos/log.log` had
leaked into a previous commit. The path is dev-only runtime
output; this prevents future accidents.

## Deferred

`SERVICENAME = "casaos"` in `backend/core/common/constants.go`
— this is the message-bus topic prefix for events emitted by
core (see `notify.go` callers). Changing it is wire-format
breakage: every subscriber filtering on this would need to
update simultaneously. Per ADR-0021's lesson learned, this
needs a dual-write window. Tracked separately.

- Sprint 5 audit #203 kill #10 — `//go:generate` directives no
longer pull from `raw.githubusercontent.com/IceWhaleTech/...`
for codegen. Per ADR-0022 (CasaOS upstream is abandoned), even
build-time pulls from upstream infra are policy violations.

All 8 cross-service codegen directives now reference the
LOCAL openapi.yaml files (already present in each service's
`api/<svc>/` dir) via relative paths:

  backend/app-management/main.go  → ../message-bus/api/...
  backend/core/main.go            → ../message-bus/api/...
  backend/local-storage/main.go   → ../message-bus/api/...
  backend/user-service/main.go    → ../message-bus/api/...
  backend/cli/main.go             → ../{app-mgmt,core,...}/api/...
                                    (5 directives, one per service)

Confirmed via `go generate ./...` in each module — codegen
produces identical output (the local copies already matched
upstream).

Side-effect: `go generate ./...` is now offline-capable (CI
builds, isolated dev environments) and faster (no GitHub
rate-limit risk).

Also deleted: `backend/core/build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/shell/update.sh`
— a `curl … | bash` from `IceWhaleTech/get/main/update.sh`.
Dead artifact, never referenced after PR #206 killed the
upstream-update path.



## [v0.5.10] — 2026-05-10
### Added
- Go API reference for `backend/pkg/*` foundation packages now lives
on the docs site at `/go-api-reference/`. Auto-generated from godoc
via `gomarkdoc` (`scripts/gen-godoc.sh`); regenerated on every
release so it never drifts from the code.

Currently scoped to `pkg/*` (100% godoc coverage, Sprint 2 Phase 6).
Per-service Go packages will be surfaced once each module hits ≥70%
coverage — tracked at #196 with a per-module audit + coverage
scorecard.

Also: REST API reference page added to nav, with embedded host link
to the live Scalar portal (per ADR-0008).

### Fixed
- Documentation site Mermaid diagrams now actually render. PR #190
added the superfences custom_fence config but Material 9.5's
documented auto-load of mermaid.js didn't actually fire on the
live site — diagrams stayed as raw `<pre class="mermaid">` blocks
with no JS to convert them.

Fix: load mermaid.js explicitly via `extra_javascript` plus a
`docs/js/mermaid-init.js` initialiser that re-runs on Material's
`navigation.instant` page swaps (so diagrams render on every
architecture page, not just the first one the user landed on).

Also auto-themes between Material's light/slate schemes so
diagrams look right in both modes.

### Internal
- CasaOS provenance sweep: deleted inherited service-level READMEs and
stripped IceWhale/CasaOS file-header banners from inherited Go files.

Two pieces:

1. **Service READMEs deleted.** All 7 `backend/<svc>/README.md` files
   plus `backend/cli/README.md` were verbatim CasaOS upstream READMEs
   (IceWhaleTech badges, codecov tokens, "Auto publish via
   `git push origin dev**`" instructions, etc.). They contained no
   PowerLab content. Removed entirely; the docs site
   (`docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/`, mkdocs portal) is the
   single source of truth.

   `backend/core/README.md` was the worst case — a full copy of the
   upstream IceWhaleTech/CasaOS marketing README living one
   directory below our own PowerLab top-level README.

   `backend/common/pkg/mod_management/README.md` was kept — it's a
   short PowerLab-relevant client snippet with no CasaOS branding.

2. **File-header banners stripped from 39 Go files.** Removed the
   `/* @Author: LinkLeong link@icewhale.com … @FilePath: /CasaOS/…
   @Website: https://www.casaos.io … Copyright (c) 2022 by icewhale,
   All Rights Reserved. */` koroFileHeader banners that sat above
   `package` declarations in inherited files. These banners had
   stale `@FilePath` paths pointing to the upstream `/CasaOS/`
   module layout, false copyright assertions, and zero documentary
   value — they were noise cargo-culted from the original VS Code
   extension config.

   Modules touched: app-management (3 files), core (33 files),
   local-storage (1), common (1), user-service (2), gateway (0).
   `go build ./...` is green for every touched module on darwin/arm64
   dev host (and local-storage on `GOOS=linux` per usual cross-target
   constraint — pre-existing macOS netlink/xattr stub limitation).

3. **Repo debris.** Deleted untracked `ui/ ` (trailing-space)
   73MB gzip blob — accidental Mac Finder cp from months ago,
   tracked by issue #174. Closes #174 implicitly.

No functional changes. Inline per-function `koroFileHeader` blocks
(`/** @description: @param {*} src … */` above functions in
network_detection.go, file.go, image.go, user.go) were left alone in
this pass — they will be cleaned up alongside the godoc Phase 2
per-package doc work, not as a pure-noise sweep.



## [v0.5.9] — 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- v0.5.9 hot-fix — closes the v0.5.8 lock-out regression.

v0.5.8 shipped the split-brain DB detector (refuse-to-start when a
service finds its DB at multiple paths) but did NOT auto-clean the
v0.5.4 hot-fix sobras. Result: hosts that had the v0.5.4 mishap state
upgraded to v0.5.8, the strict check fired, user-service refused to
boot, login broke. Symptom looked identical to the v0.5.7 JWT-keypair
bug but was a completely different cause introduced by my own fix.

Three pieces:

1. **Backend: `paths.AutoMoveLegacyAside`** — for known-stale legacy
   paths (user.db, local-storage.db: paths the service NEVER reads
   from), automatically move the duplicate to `<path>.bak.<unix-ts>`
   before the strict split-brain check runs. Non-destructive: the
   file is preserved as a backup, not deleted. user-service and
   local-storage main.go now call this BEFORE `AssertNoSplitBrain`.

   For genuinely-ambiguous duplicates (core's casaOS.db at multiple
   paths where either could be authoritative), `AssertNoSplitBrain`
   remains as the safety net — operator picks.

2. **UI: success toast + auto-reload** — the updater store now shows
   a visible success toast when an upgrade completes successfully
   and auto-reloads the page after 2.5s so the user doesn't have to
   refresh manually. Pre-v0.5.9 the upgrade silently completed and
   the user was left staring at "Upgrading…" until they refreshed
   by hand. Failures show an error toast (no auto-reload, the
   previous version is still running and reloading would be
   confusing).

3. **Integration test** at `scripts/test-upgrade-resolves-stale-legacy_test.sh`
   — builds the user-service binary and runs it against a sandbox
   simulating the v0.5.4 mishap state (both canonical and legacy
   paths exist). Asserts: legacy moved aside, canonical untouched,
   stderr mentions the move, .bak content preserved. This is the
   test that SHOULD have run before v0.5.8 shipped — closes
   #169 in spirit (Phase 1.5 release-checklist as automated test).

7 new Go test cases at backend/common/utils/paths/db_test.go cover
the AutoMoveLegacyAside contract: moves stale duplicate, no-op when
canonical missing/empty, no-op when legacy missing, multiple legacy
paths, idempotent re-run, and integration with AssertNoSplitBrain.

4 new UI test cases at ui/src/lib/stores/updater.test.ts lock the
success toast + reload timing + failure toast + diagnostic
surfacing.



## [v0.5.8] — 2026-05-10
### Added
- Documentation site at https://neochaotic.github.io/powerlab/ —
mkdocs-material foundation. The Sprint 4.5/pre-v1.0 docs Phase 3
is brought forward into the active flow rather than waiting for a
pre-tag bundle (per the v1.0-deferred decision).

Initial nav covers:

  - Home (landing + project status)
  - Getting started: Install, First boot, Updating
  - Architecture: 6 existing pages reused (topology, request
    lifecycle, foundation interfaces, dependency graph, data
    persistence, CasaOS strangler)
  - Coexistence with CasaOS: new overview translating ADR-0021
    for end users
  - Operations: HTTPS setup, update manifest, release checklist,
    troubleshooting (existing top-level docs)
  - Audits: db-paths, casaos-dependencies, sprint retros, UI
    feature map, endpoint usage, dead code
  - Decisions (ADRs): index of all 21 records

Build runs in CI on every PR (--strict mode catches broken links
+ missing pages). Deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main.

Going forward, every PR that adds a feature or changes behavior
should consider whether a docs page change is needed alongside.

### Fixed
- Sprint 4 / #179 — installer no longer leaves stale duplicate DB
files. The v0.5.4 hot-fix migration copied `user.db` and
`local-storage.db` to `/var/lib/powerlab/db/<file>.db`, but those
services actually read from `/var/lib/powerlab/<file>.db` (no
`/db/` subdir). Result was 30+ minutes of debug looking at the
wrong file during a real prod incident. The migration now writes
to the canonical paths, and a boot-time split-brain check in
user-service refuses to start if both copies still exist with
data — printing recovery instructions instead of silently picking
one and risking persistent data drift.

New centralised path helpers at `backend/common/utils/paths/db.go`
expose the canonical destination for every service's persistent
files; future migrations consume them so a path convention change
happens in one place. `docs/audits/db-paths.md` is the new
single-source-of-truth audit (per ADR-0019).

Five layers of defense land in this PR:

- L1 helpers centralised
- L2 migration writes to correct destinations + has split-brain regression test
- L3 boot-time refuse-to-start check
- L4 18-assertion regression suite (8 Go + 10 bash)
- L5 install.sh audit step that warns operator before the service crashes

Existing installs are not auto-cleaned — the boot-time check
surfaces split-brain with operator-actionable instructions
rather than risking destructive automatic actions on data the
operator might still need.

- Sprint 4 / #85 PR-C — closes the CasaOS coexistence story for
newly installed apps. PowerLab and CasaOS can now run on the
same host without label collisions or AppData races for any new
app installed after this PR. install.sh's hard-block relaxes to
notice. #85 DoD met for new installs; existing-app migration
deferred to a follow-up tool.

Two pieces:

1. **Compose volume-source rewrite at install time**
   (`service/compose_service.go::rewriteAppDataPathsToCanonical`).
   Runs after the existing `remapVolumePaths` pass. Substitutes
   `<storagePath>/AppData/` → `<storagePath>/PowerLabAppData/` in
   every bind-mount source. Newly installed apps bind into the
   per-product canonical tree from day one.

2. **install.sh CasaOS coexistence block relaxed**
   (`scripts/package-linux.sh`). Was: hard refuse-to-install
   unless `--allow-coexist`. Now: friendly notice describing
   the now-clean coexistence (with explicit caveat that apps
   already installed remain at `/DATA/AppData/`). The
   `--allow-coexist` flag is preserved as a silently-accepted
   no-op for any operator runbooks that pass it.

4 new regression tests at `service/autoremap_test.go` lock the
rewrite contract: rewrites legacy AppData prefix, honors custom
storagePath (macOS dev installs), no-op when storagePath empty,
ignores non-bind volumes.

ADR-0021 amended in this PR ("Subsequent decision: existing-app
migration deferred") explaining why the original on-boot
mv-based migration was removed: it would have invalidated
bind-mount sources in on-disk compose YAMLs, producing apparent
data loss on next container start. Doing it correctly requires
an atomic dir-move + YAML-rewrite which is sizeable enough to
deserve its own PR + test suite.

This completes the #85 sub-PR sequence:
  - PR-A (#181): ADR-0021 + label/path helpers + 16 tests
  - PR-B (#182): wire all label call sites; dual-write active
  - PR-C (this one): compose volume rewrite + coexistence relax

### Internal
- Sprint 4 / #85 foundation — adds ADR-0021 + the
`backend/app-management/common/labels.go` package that will be the
single source of truth for every Docker container label PowerLab
reads or writes. No service code changes yet; the next sub-PR
rewrites the call sites in service/container.go and friends to
consume `common.IsPowerLabApp` / `common.LabelValue` /
`common.BuildLabels`.

ADR-0021 records two coexistence decisions:

- Container labels move from unnamespaced flat keys (`casaos`,
  `origin`, `icon`, ...) to canonical `io.powerlab.v1.*`
  reverse-DNS names. One release window of dual-write keeps
  existing PowerLab containers visible.
- AppData tree moves from `<StoragePath>/AppData/` (collides with
  CasaOS) to `<StoragePath>/PowerLabAppData/` (per-product).

16 regression test cases in `common/labels_test.go` +
`common/appdata_test.go` lock the dual-read / dual-write contract,
the AppData rename, and the legacy-key completeness invariant.

This is the first of ~3 sub-PRs for #85. PR-B wires service code
to the new helpers; PR-C does the AppData on-boot migration.

- Sprint 4 / #85 PR-B — wires every container-label call site in
app-management to consume the helpers landed in PR-A. Containers
PowerLab creates from this point forward carry both the canonical
`io.powerlab.v1.*` labels AND the legacy unnamespaced labels
(per ADR-0021's one-release-window dual-write); the "is mine"
filter accepts either, so containers PowerLab created before this
PR stay visible in the panel without forcing a recreate.

Sites rewritten:

- `service/container.go` — list filter, value reads, write block
  (12 inline label writes consolidated to one `BuildLabels` call)
- `service/v1/app.go` — label reads in legacy V1 Custom App
  inspect path
- `route/v1/docker.go` — origin check during delete

Orphan constant `ContainerLabelV1AppStoreID` removed from
`common/constants.go` (its single string is now the
`LegacyLabelAppStoreIDKey` helper constant; reads go through
`LabelValue(LabelAppStoreIDKey)` which dual-reads both).

No new tests — the dual-read / dual-write contract is exhaustively
covered by the 12 cases in `common/labels_test.go` from PR-A.
Direct map reads are now an anti-pattern that bypasses the
contract; reviewer can grep for `Labels["origin"]` etc. to verify
none remain.

Next sub-PR (#85 PR-C): on-boot AppData migration + install.sh
coexistence-block relax (per #85 DoD).



## [v0.5.7] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- Sprint 3 retrospective at `docs/audits/sprint-3-retrospective.md`.

Per ADR-0019 (tech-debt tracking pattern), retrospectives live as
audits. This one captures the v0.5.4 prod incident + the long-tail
bugs and process gaps surfaced during the rebrand wave, with each
follow-up tracked as a labeled GitHub issue (#169–#174).

Includes:
  - What went well (4 items)
  - What went wrong (7 items, each with the lesson + remediation
    already in flight)
  - 6 follow-up issues opened (#169 phase 1.5 test, #170 migration-
    tool audit, #171 flag.Parse template, #172 branch protection,
    #173 goleak convention, #174 ui/ cleanup)
  - Sprint 4 fit recommendation per issue (which to add to Sprint
    4 vs defer)
  - Outcome scoreboard (4 releases, 12+ structural PRs, ~3500 LOC
    removed, 80+ regression test assertions, 3 prod incidents
    fixed + tested, 4 process improvements)

### Changed
- **Sessions now survive PowerLab upgrades.** The JWT signing
keypair is persisted to `user.db` and reused across service
restarts, instead of being regenerated fresh on every startup.

Pre-v0.5.7, every restart of `user-service` (including every
in-app upgrade) silently invalidated every outstanding JWT
cookie — users got logged out on every upgrade. This was
inherited from CasaOS; PowerLab kept the behavior unchanged
and a misleading godoc comment described it as a "deliberate
trade-off." It wasn't — see ADR-0020 for the full story and
the threat-model discussion.

Behavior change in this release:

  - **Default**: keypair persists in `user.db` (new
    `jwt_keypair` table, single-row, PEM-encoded). First boot
    generates one; every subsequent restart reuses it.
  - **Opt-out** for higher-threat environments: set
    `POWERLAB_EPHEMERAL_JWT_KEY=true` to restore the
    pre-v0.5.7 ephemeral behavior.

Threat model trade-off documented in ADR-0020. Summary: the
cost ("every upgrade logs everyone out") is recurring and
certain; the benefit ("stolen disk image can't forge tokens")
is contingent on an attacker who already has bcrypt password
hashes + config secrets + the ability to install backdoors
in the binary. Net positive for the home-server use case.

Regression test at `backend/user-service/service/keypair_store_test.go`
— 5 cases including the THE regression for #176
(`TestLoadOrGenerate_StableAcrossCalls`) which asserts two
consecutive `NewUserService`-equivalent calls return the same
keypair.

Closes #176.

### Internal
- Release v0.5.7 — JWT keypair persistence + Sprint 3 retrospective.

Headline user-visible change:
  - #176 / ADR-0020: sessions now survive PowerLab upgrades.
    JWT signing keypair persists in user.db; opt back into
    pre-v0.5.7 ephemeral behavior via POWERLAB_EPHEMERAL_JWT_KEY=true.
    First time a real PowerLab-owned decision overrode an inherited
    CasaOS one (rather than just rebranding the surface).

Plus:
  - docs/audits/sprint-3-retrospective.md: formal retro on the
    v0.5.4 incident + Sprint 3 outcomes. 6 follow-up issues opened
    (#169–#174) tracking remaining process improvements.

Migration: 0002_jwt_keypair.sql adds a single-row table to user.db.
Idempotent on re-run; CHECK (id = 1) prevents drift.

Behavior on upgrade from v0.5.6: first restart after the upgrade
generates + persists the keypair. Every subsequent restart reuses
it. Net effect: ONE more "logged out on refresh" event during the
v0.5.6 → v0.5.7 upgrade itself; zero from there on.



## [v0.5.6] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- Sprint 4 PR5 — rename `service.ErrComposeExtensionNameXCasaOSNotFound`
→ `service.ErrComposeExtensionNotFound`. Per the audit's PR
breakdown (`docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`).

The `XCasaOS` specificity in the original name was misleading
after PR #141 landed the extension-key priority chain
(`service/extension.go::extensionPriority` accepts `x-powerlab`,
`x-web`, OR `x-casaos`). The error is raised when NONE of the
three keys are present — its name should describe that
generically.

6 sites mechanically renamed:
  - `service/errs.go`            (declaration)
  - `service/compose_app.go`     (3 returns / comparisons)
  - `route/v2/compose_app.go`    (1 comparison)
  - `cmd/validator/pkg/validate.go` (1 return)

No wire format. No UI consumer. Pure-internal rename.

### Removed
- Sprint 4 PR3 — drops dead `MyAppList` handler + renames Go vars
in active sites. Per the audit's PR breakdown
(`docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`), this is the
third smallest-first chunk after PR1 (cosmetic literals) and
PR2 (CasaOSGlobalVariables rename).

Removed:

  backend/app-management/route/v1/docker.go::MyAppList
      Dead code — its route registration in route/v1.go was
      commented out for an unknown duration. Was the only
      consumer of the legacy `casaos_apps` JSON wire-format
      key. Active app-list flow lives in
      route/v2/internal_web.go's WebAppGridItem* — untouched.

  backend/app-management/route/v1.go (the commented-out reg)
      Removed the `// v1ContainerGroup.GET("", v1.MyAppList)`
      line for clarity.

Renamed (Go vars only — no wire format change):

  casaOSApps → managedApps   (4 sites in service/container.go,
                              1 site in route/v2/internal_web.go)
  casaOSApp  → managedApp    (1 site)

No UI consumer (verified by grep), no remaining wire-format
references to `casaos_apps`. PR4 (Docker label dual-write — the
big one) and PR5 (ErrComposeExtensionNameXCasaOSNotFound rename)
remain in the Sprint 4 backlog.

### Fixed
- user-service `EventListen` no longer crashes its goroutine when
message-bus disconnects or sends a malformed event payload (#160).

The original code had three nil-deref paths that combined to
panic on every message-bus restart cycle:

  1. `ws.Read` err → no continue, fell through to unmarshal of
     zero bytes
  2. `json.Unmarshal` err → no continue, fell through to
     `*event.Uuid`
  3. `event.Uuid == nil` even when unmarshal succeeded (no uuid
     in payload) → panic at the assignment

SafeGo (pkg/lifecycle) recovered the panic so the process kept
running, but the goroutine died on every cycle. Visible in
production logs every time the user clicked the Update button
(which restarts message-bus mid-flight) — see #160 for context.

Fix extracts payload parsing into `parseEventPayload()` returning
`(*EventModel, error)` instead of mutating shared state inline.
Each error path returns a useful message; caller skips that
message and stays connected.

Regression test at `event_listen_test.go` — 6 cases:
  - empty payload returns error (the v0.5.4 disconnect shape)
  - malformed JSON returns error
  - missing uuid returns error (the actual line:77 crash shape)
  - null uuid returns error
  - valid payload returns full model
  - fuzz: 9 crash-prone inputs, none panic

Bonus fix: `ws.Read` error now `break`s the inner loop (was
silent fall-through) so the outer reconnect loop fires
immediately instead of cycling on dead websocket reads.

Closes #160.

- install.sh now prunes old upgrade snapshots after each successful
install. Before this fix, every upgrade left ~100MB of binaries +
UI bundle behind in `/var/lib/powerlab/backups/pre-upgrade-<ts>/`
→ disk filled up over time. v0.5.4 prod incident retrospective
surfaced this when the user accumulated 4 snapshots in a single
debugging session.

Default: keep the 3 newest snapshots. Override with
`POWERLAB_BACKUP_KEEP=N` env var:
  - `POWERLAB_BACKUP_KEEP=5` → paranoid retention
  - `POWERLAB_BACKUP_KEEP=0` → keep ALL (forensic mode for
    post-mortems)

Only directories matching `pre-upgrade-*` are touched. Manual
exports, README files, or any other backups dir contents are
left alone.

Regression test at `scripts/check-backup-retention_test.sh` —
14 assertions across 5 scenarios (5→3 pruning order, no-op when
under threshold, empty dir, KEEP=0 disables, non-snapshot dirs
preserved).

### Internal
- Release v0.5.6 — v0.5.4 incident retrospective. Long tail of
bugs surfaced during the user's prod upgrade debug, plus
defenses so the class doesn't repeat.

Bug fixes:
  - #160: user-service event-listener no longer crashes on
    message-bus disconnect or malformed payload (3 nil-deref
    paths fixed). 6 regression tests including 9-input fuzz.

Operational improvements:
  - install.sh prunes old upgrade snapshots (keep last 3 by
    default, POWERLAB_BACKUP_KEEP env var override). 14
    regression tests.

Sprint 4 cosmetic continuations:
  - PR3 (#85): drop dead MyAppList handler + casaos_apps JSON
    wire-format key + Go-side casaOSApps → managedApps rename.
  - PR5 (#85): ErrComposeExtensionNameXCasaOSNotFound →
    ErrComposeExtensionNotFound (the X-CasaOS specificity was
    misleading after the x-powerlab/x-web/x-casaos extension
    chain landed).

Sprint 4 PR4 (Docker label dual-write — the big one) remains
in backlog: needs design + integration testing for in-place
container migration.

No end-user behavior change beyond the bug fixes.



## [v0.5.5] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- Sprint 4 prep audit: `docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`.

Read-only deep-dive on the CasaOS surface still inside
app-management (the largest service, ~13,300 LOC, the only one
without a dedicated kill series). Maps every legacy item into 5
risk-categorized buckets:

1. Compose extension `x-casaos` (ecosystem-coupled, dual-read
   already in place via `service/extension.go::extensionPriority`)
2. Docker label `"casaos"` discriminator (4 sites; needs
   dual-write migration before legacy label can be dropped)
3. CasaOS-team URLs (intentional data sources, kept)
4. Code-internal literals (~10 files; mostly mechanical, pre-v1.0
   wire-format renames allowed)
5. License headers / @FilePath markers (intentional attribution,
   kept)

Includes a suggested Sprint 4 PR breakdown ordered smallest-to-
largest. Companion deep-dive to `docs/audits/casaos-dependencies.md`.

Per ADR-0019: read-only audit, refreshed when Sprint 4 lands or
when the compose-extension contract changes.

### Changed
- Two cosmetic CasaOS literals in app-management renamed to
PowerLab equivalents. First of 5 PRs proposed in the Sprint 4
prep audit (`docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`),
ordered smallest-first.

Renames:

  .casaos-appstore       →  .powerlab-appstore
      Marker file written into each app store dir to identify
      store provenance from disk. Regenerated on every store
      sync — no migration needed.

  casaos-compose-app-*   →  powerlab-compose-app-*
      os.MkdirTemp prefix for the working directory used while
      parsing a docker-compose.yml. Temporary by definition,
      cleaned up in the same function via defer.

Both are pure-internal: no UI consumer, no wire format, no
on-disk state worth migrating. Cosmetic surface cleanup so
logs / strace / process listings stop advertising upstream
CasaOS branding from inside a PowerLab process.

- Rename `CasaOSGlobalVariables` struct → `AppLifecycleFlags`.
Sprint 4 PR2 from the prep audit
(`docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`).

Same struct, same single field (`AppChange bool`), better name.
Used as process-global state to invalidate the app-list cache
when an install/uninstall handler in `route/v1/docker.go` flips
the flag, then `service/container.go::GetContainerAppList`
consumes it.

6 sites renamed across 4 files:
  - `model/sys_common.go`     (the struct itself + new godoc)
  - `pkg/config/init.go`      (the package-global init)
  - `route/v1/docker.go`      (2 setters in install + uninstall)
  - `service/container.go`    (1 reader + 1 reset)

No wire format. No UI consumer. No on-disk state. Pure-internal
rename so the type name describes what it does instead of where
it came from.

### Fixed
- install.sh now migrates `/var/lib/casaos/*` → `/var/lib/powerlab/*`
on upgrade. Closes the v0.5.4 prod incident (issue #158) where
hosts upgrading from v0.5.x lost access to user accounts because
PR #140 flipped data paths but install.sh didn't migrate the data.

Symptom on the affected host: every API returned 401 Unauthorized,
login returned 400 Bad Request — user-service was reading an empty
`/var/lib/powerlab/db/user.db` while the actual user data sat in
`/var/lib/casaos/db/user.db`. Hot-fixed manually by copying the DBs.

Fix: extracted the migration logic into a standalone testable
script, `scripts/migrate-casaos-data.sh`, which install.sh sources
and invokes after stopping services + before starting them. The
script:

  - Copies subdirs `db apps appstore conf 1` from
    `/var/lib/casaos/<sub>` to `/var/lib/powerlab/<sub>` only
    when destination doesn't exist (never overwrites live data).
  - Copies known DB files individually (db/user.db,
    db/message-bus.db, db/casaOS.db, db/local-storage.db,
    db/local-storage.json) for the case where the destination
    dir EXISTS but specific files are missing — the actual v0.5.4
    mishap shape (message-bus had created /var/lib/powerlab/db/
    with just message-bus.db, no user.db).
  - Idempotent — safe to run on every upgrade; no-op when the
    destination is fully populated.
  - Source preserved (`/var/lib/casaos/*` not deleted) — leaves
    a manual rollback path.

Test coverage at `scripts/migrate-casaos-data_test.sh`:
  - Test 1: v0.5.4 mishap scenario (user.db missing) → migrated;
    message-bus.db NOT overwritten.
  - Test 2: fresh install (no /var/lib/casaos) → no-op.
  - Test 3: full upgrade (no /var/lib/powerlab) → all subdirs copied.
  - Test 4: idempotent re-run → user mutations preserved.
  - Test 5: source preservation → casaos files untouched.

10 assertions across 5 scenarios. PREFIX env var lets the test
point at a sandbox dir so no real /var/lib paths are touched.

Closes #158.

- Release builds now correctly stamp `commit`, `date`, and PowerLab
version into the binaries. Closes the v0.5.4 mishap where the
in-UI updater showed `current="dev"` and prompted "Update
available" forever even when the user was on the latest release
(issue #159).

Two bugs in one ldflag string in `scripts/package-linux.sh`:

  1. `-X main.version=$VERSION` — wrong variable name. Each
     service's `main.go` declares `commit` and `date`, never
     `version`. Go's `-X` is fail-soft: if the target var doesn't
     exist, the build still succeeds, the assignment is silently
     dropped, and the binary keeps the default `"private build"`.

  2. `-X github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/common.POWERLAB_VERSION=...`
     — dead path after PR #151 renamed every Go module to
     `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/*`. Same fail-soft
     behavior: silently no-op, version constant stays "dev".

Fix sets the four ldflags that actually exist in the codebase:

  -X main.commit=<git short SHA>                     (every service)
  -X main.date=<UTC ISO-8601 timestamp>              (every service)
  -X github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/core/common.POWERLAB_VERSION=$VERSION
                                                     (core only —
                                                     Go ignores the
                                                     flag for other
                                                     services)
  -X github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/core/route/v1.powerLabVersionAtCompileTime=$VERSION
                                                     (read by the
                                                     updater's
                                                     currentPowerLab-
                                                     Version() to
                                                     compare against
                                                     the manifest)

Includes regression test at
`scripts/check-package-linux-ldflags_test.sh` (8 assertions):
  - All 4 expected ldflag target paths are present in package-
    linux.sh
  - The 2 deprecated targets (the v0.5.4 mishap shapes) are
    absent
  - The 2 target Go vars (POWERLAB_VERSION, powerLabVersion-
    AtCompileTime) actually exist in the source — catches future
    renames that would silently break the build pipeline.

Closes #159.

### Internal
- Pre-tag check: `scripts/check-manifest-fresh.sh` refuses to
proceed when `release-manifest.yaml` summary is identical to
the previously published GitHub release's summary.

Catches the failure mode that bit v0.5.4: maintainer forgot
to update the YAML, so the manifest.json shipped with v0.5.0's
summary text. Hot-fixed via `gh release upload manifest.json
--clobber` after the fact (see issue #156).

Wired into `docs/release-checklist.md` Phase 1.

Includes regression tests at
`scripts/check-manifest-fresh_test.sh` covering:
  - Identical summary → exit 1 (the v0.5.4 case)
  - Different summary → exit 0
  - Empty summary in fixture → exit 0 (defensive)
  - Nonexistent fixture path → exit 2

Also refreshed `release-manifest.yaml` summary to match v0.5.4's
hot-patched text — so v0.5.5 maintainer must edit the YAML
before tagging, otherwise the new check blocks them.

- Release v0.5.5 — v0.5.4 incident hotfix. Two real upgrade-path
bugs fixed with regression tests:

  - #158: install.sh now auto-migrates /var/lib/casaos/* →
    /var/lib/powerlab/* on upgrade. Without this, v0.5.x → v0.5.4
    hosts ended up with empty /var/lib/powerlab/db/ → user-service
    couldn't find users → login returned 400 → UI unusable.
    Hot-fixed manually on the affected host; this PR closes the
    class permanently. 5-scenario regression test
    (scripts/migrate-casaos-data_test.sh) locks the behavior.

  - #159: release builds now correctly inject commit / build-date /
    version into the binary. The v0.5.4 ldflag string was double-
    broken — wrong variable name AND dead module path (after #151
    module rename). Result: binary identified itself as "dev",
    in-UI updater showed "Update available" forever even on the
    latest release, triggered no-op upgrade loop that restarted
    services + invalidated JWT. Two regression tests
    (check-package-linux-ldflags_test.sh + main_version_stamp_test.go)
    catch future bit-rot of the build pipeline.

  - #156: pre-tag check that release-manifest.yaml summary was
    refreshed for the new version. The check failed when this
    paragraph was being drafted — exactly the case it was added
    to catch. 4-assertion regression test
    (check-manifest-fresh_test.sh).

Plus Sprint 4 progress (still in flight):
  - #85 PR1: rename .casaos-appstore + casaos-compose-app-* internal
    literals.
  - #85 PR2: CasaOSGlobalVariables struct → AppLifecycleFlags.
  - Sprint 4 prep audit at
    docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md.

No end-user behavior change beyond the bug fixes — same wire
formats, same DB schema, same settings.



## [v0.5.4] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- Sprint 3 closeout documentation.

- **ADR-0019**: codifies the project's tech-debt tracking pattern.
  Three sources of truth — `docs/audits/` for structural audits,
  `docs/decisions/` for ADRs, GitHub issues with labels for the
  live work queue. **No `TECH-DEBT.md` / `TODO.md` at the repo
  root** (they would inevitably go stale and lie). Includes the
  refresh-discipline rules so the next person who has the reflex
  to add one finds the reasoning first.

- **`docs/audits/casaos-dependencies.md`** refreshed per the
  ADR-0019 convention (Update section appended at top, Sprint 1
  baseline preserved below as historical record). Captures the
  Sprint 2 + Sprint 3 outcomes: 10 closeout PRs (#139–#148),
  ~3500 LOC removed, cloud-drive infrastructure killed in both
  local-storage and core, /etc/casaos → /etc/powerlab paths
  completed across 5 services, casaos:* → powerlab:* topics,
  PersistentTypeCasaOS rebranded, 165 logger sites migrated.
  Documents what's left in the CasaOS surface (Go module path
  rename is the next major target).

### Changed
- Renamed all Go module paths from legacy `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-*`
to PowerLab-owned `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/*`. This is the
final structural rebrand step — every Go service in the tree now compiles
under a PowerLab module identity.

**Renamed modules (6):**

| Service          | Old module                                     | New module                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `app-management` | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppManagement` | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/app-management` |
| `user-service`   | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService`   | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/user-service`   |
| `core`           | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS`               | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/core`           |
| `local-storage`  | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-LocalStorage`  | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/local-storage`  |
| `common`         | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-Common`        | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/common`         |
| `cli`            | `github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-CLI`           | `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/cli`            |

All `replace github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-Common => ../common` directives
across dependent services were updated to point at the new module path.
The `cli` service gained a new `replace` directive (it previously fetched
`CasaOS-Common` from the network).

**Intentionally NOT touched:**

- `go:generate bash -c "... https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceWhaleTech/..."`
  URLs in `main.go` files. These point at the upstream IceWhaleTech repos on
  GitHub as external data sources for `oapi-codegen`. The generated package
  names (e.g. `-package casaos`, `-package user_service`) are also untouched
  — they are local Go package names, not import paths.
- License headers, `@Website`, and `@FilePath: /CasaOS/...` markers in file
  headers. These are historical attribution per ADR-0019.
- Filesystem path constants in `cmd/migration-tool/main.go` (those are the
  legacy CasaOS migration tools that intentionally read from upstream
  `/etc/casaos/...` paths).

- Service config paths fully rebranded from `/etc/casaos` to
`/etc/powerlab`. Sprint 3 Phase 3 — completes the structural
CasaOS strangler for filesystem layout (#101).

Why this matters now: install.sh + the systemd units already
wrote configs to `/etc/powerlab/` and started services with
`-c /etc/powerlab/<svc>.conf`, but the in-binary defaults
(used when `-c` is absent and at first-boot file creation)
still pointed at `/etc/casaos/<svc>.conf`. Two services
(message-bus, local-storage) also imported the upstream
CasaOS-Common Go module rather than the local fork at
`backend/common/`, so even `constants.DefaultConfigPath`
resolved to `/etc/casaos`. Net effect: a class of subtle
divergence between what install.sh shipped and what the
binary read.

Production bug uncovered while doing this:
install.sh used to ship `casaos.conf.sample` into
`/etc/powerlab/casaos.conf`, but systemd starts the core
service with `-c /etc/powerlab/core.conf`. The file basenames
disagreed → the binary opened a non-existent path,
silently created an empty `core.conf`, and dropped every
shipped default. Renamed the sample + the in-binary const
(`CasaOSConfigFilePath` → `CoreConfigFilePath`) so the
three sources (sample basename, systemd `-c` flag, Go
default) finally agree.

Concrete changes:

- 5 services: `build/sysroot/etc/casaos/` →
  `build/sysroot/etc/powerlab/` (renamed, not deleted —
  the embedded sample is still shipped via `//go:embed`).
- 5 services: `//go:embed` directives updated to point at
  the new sysroot path.
- `core/pkg/config/config.go`: `CasaOSConfigFilePath` →
  `CoreConfigFilePath`, value `casaos.conf` → `core.conf`.
- `message-bus/config/config.go`,
  `local-storage/pkg/config/config.go`: hardcoded
  `/etc/casaos/<svc>.conf` literal → derived via
  `filepath.Join(constants.DefaultConfigPath, ...)`.
- `message-bus/go.mod`, `local-storage/go.mod`: added
  `replace github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-Common =>
  ../common` so they share the local fork's Linux/darwin
  paths (`/etc/powerlab` / `/opt/powerlab/etc`) like
  app-management/user-service/core already did.
- `scripts/package-linux.sh`: emit `core.conf.sample`
  instead of `casaos.conf.sample` (matches systemd `-c`).
- 4 new `pkg/config/config_test.go` files (TDD): assert
  the path matches `constants.DefaultConfigPath` AND
  contains no legacy `/casaos/` substring. These would
  have caught the prod mismatch.

Behavior on existing installs:
- Sample is only written on first install when the file
  is absent (install.sh line 504: `if [[ ! -f ... ]]`).
  Existing `/etc/powerlab/casaos.conf` from prior installs
  is left untouched — but ALSO never read by core, since
  systemd passes `-c /etc/powerlab/core.conf`. So the old
  file becomes a harmless orphan; no migration needed.

Compatibility:
- The legacy `/etc/casaos.conf` (single file, distinct
  from the per-service `/etc/casaos/<svc>.conf`) is still
  read by `version.LegacyCasaOSConfigFilePath` for
  co-resident hosts; that path is intentional CasaOS
  interop and unchanged.
- The `/etc/casaos` production marker in
  `constants/paths.go::devProductionMarkers` is also
  unchanged — it lets a binary running on a co-resident
  CasaOS host detect the install rather than falling
  into dev-sandbox mode.

- Message-bus topic prefixes migrated from `casaos:*` to
`powerlab:*` for self-describing routing in logs + traces.
Sprint 3 Phase 3 — third structural rebrand PR (#101).

Concrete renames in core's EventTypes registry + all
publish call-sites:

  casaos:system:utilization  → powerlab:system:utilization
  casaos:file:operate        → powerlab:file:operate

Both topics + their publish call-sites are now wrapped in
named constants in `backend/core/common/message.go`
(EventSystemUtilization, EventFileOperate) so the rename
is single-source.

Held back: `casaos:file:recover` stays on the legacy
prefix (kept as `EventCloudFileRecover` const) because
it's still referenced by core's parallel cloud-drive
infrastructure (drivers/{dropbox,google_drive,onedrive},
route/v1/recover.go). That topic dies together with that
infrastructure in a follow-up PR mirroring #139's
local-storage cloud-drive removal.

Safety: verified by grep across the SvelteKit UI + all
6 backend services that no PowerLab component subscribes
to the `casaos:` prefix. The rename is non-breaking.

- /v1/storage `PersistedIn` field value `"casaos"` → `"powerlab"`.
Sprint 3 Phase 3 — fourth structural rebrand PR (#101). The
Go-side const also renamed: `PersistentTypeCasaOS` →
`PersistentTypePowerLab` (value `"powerlab"`).

Wire-format change. Pre-v1.0 (current is v0.5.3), so allowed.
Verified by grep across the SvelteKit UI that no PowerLab
consumer switches on the literal `"casaos"` value.

Risk: external API consumers (apps installed in the user's
PowerLab) that read /v1/storage and switch on the
`PersistedIn` field. Such consumers would need to update.
No PowerLab-shipped app does this. v1.0 wire format will be
documented as part of #71 (mkdocs-material site).

- Embedded sysroot config samples rebranded — internal CasaOS
paths swapped for PowerLab equivalents. Sprint 3 Phase 3
follow-up to #140 (which renamed the directories but left
contents alone).

Why this matters: each service `//go:embed`s its sample as
the `_confSample` string, used to seed `/etc/powerlab/<svc>.conf`
on first boot when no config file exists. install.sh's heredoc
samples already wrote PowerLab paths to disk in production,
but the embedded samples still leaked CasaOS paths into:

  - dev mode (running the binary by hand, no install.sh)
  - any future install path that didn't go through install.sh
  - readers of the source code looking for documentation

Path renames inside each sample:

  /var/run/casaos       → /var/run/powerlab
  /var/log/casaos       → /var/log/powerlab
  /var/lib/casaos       → /var/lib/powerlab
  /usr/share/casaos     → /usr/share/powerlab

core.conf.sample: dropped the dead CasaOS upstream endpoints
(`ServerApi = https://api.casaos.io/casaos-api`,
`Handshake = socket.casaos.io`, `Token =`). PowerLab has its
own version + updater stack (#21 in-UI updater) and never
reads these — leaving them in the sample risked silent network
requests to casaos.io infrastructure on first boot. Removed
rather than blanked so they're not even mentioned.

Kept (intentional, external 3rd-party data source):
app-management.conf.sample's `appstore = https://github.com/
bigbeartechworld/big-bear-casaos/...` — community-maintained
app store repo whose name predates PowerLab. The data flowing
through it is the actual app catalog; renaming the URL would
break the install.

- local-storage finishes the migration off the legacy CasaOS
`logger.X(msg, zap.X(...))` helpers and onto PowerLab's own
`pkg/logging` Logger interface (built on `log/slog`). Same
pattern user-service, gateway, message-bus, and core were
migrated to in earlier sprints (ADR-0025).

Per-package work:

  backend/local-storage/service          (disk, storage, usb, notify)
  backend/local-storage/service/v2       (merge, mount, fstab)
  backend/local-storage/route/v1         (storage, disk, usb)
  backend/local-storage/route/v2         (merge)
  backend/local-storage/pkg/utils/merge  (merge.go)
  backend/local-storage/pkg/mergerfs     (mergerfs.go)
  backend/local-storage/main.go          (residual sites + SetLogger
                                          wiring for every package)

Each migrated package exposes a `var _log pkglogging.Logger`
+ `func SetLogger(l)` so main() can hand the configured
foundation logger to every package; before main() runs every
`_log` defaults to a permissive json/info logger so init-time
goroutines don't crash on a nil receiver.

Mechanical 1:1 mapping:

  logger.Info(msg, zap.X(...))                → _log.Info(ctx, msg, slog.X(...))
  logger.Error(msg, zap.Error(err), zap.X..)  → _log.Error(ctx, msg, err, slog.X(...))
  logger.Warn(msg, ...)                       → _log.Warn(ctx, msg, ...)

HTTP handlers pass `ctx.Request().Context()`; background
goroutines and helpers off the request path use
`context.Background()`. No behaviour change beyond the
emission backend.

Side-effect cleanup:

  - Drop the legacy `logger.LogInit(...)` file-rotation
    bootstrap from main.go — with zero remaining call
    sites it was setting up zap log files nothing wrote
    to.
  - Drop the now-dead CasaOS `utils/logger` and
    `go.uber.org/zap` imports from every migrated file.

Out of scope (intentionally untouched):

  - `cmd/migration-tool/main.go` keeps the legacy logger;
    it's a one-shot DB migration tool that runs outside
    the service process.
  - `service/storage.go` (StorageService) and
    `pkg/utils/httper/drive.go` are dead code after #139
    (cloud-drive removal) — registered in service.go but
    never called. Grep confirms zero non-self callers.
    Deletion left to a follow-up PR to keep this one
    mechanical.

Final logger-call-site count in local-storage/ (excluding
cmd/migration-tool, tests, comments): 0 — down from ~143
before this PR.

- user-service SERVICENAME and message-bus topic rebranded.
Sprint 3 Phase 3 — sixth structural rebrand PR (#106).

Renames:

  SERVICENAME           "CasaOS-UserService" → "PowerLab-UserService"
  Event topic           "zimaos:user:save_config"
                        → "powerlab:user:save_config"

SERVICENAME is published as the SourceID on every event the
service emits and registers under in /v2/message_bus/event_type.
Surfaces in every cross-service log line that mentions a
user-service event — the legacy value advertised CasaOS
branding from inside a PowerLab process. The topic rename
follows the powerlab:* convention established in #141.

Wire-format change. Pre-v1.0 (current is v0.5.3). Verified by
grep across the SvelteKit UI that no PowerLab consumer
switches on either of the legacy values.

Held back: the Go module path
`github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService/...` is still
upstream-named because renaming a module is a sweeping
refactor in its own right (every import line in the service
+ the cli that consumes the user-service codegen). Tracked
for a separate PR; the user-visible rebrand surface (event
SourceID + topics) is what this PR fixes.

### Removed
- Cloud drive backends (Dropbox, Google Drive) and the
/v1/cloud, /v1/driver, /v1/recover endpoints removed entirely
in Sprint 3 Phase 3 (#101 / casaos-strip option 3).

Why: cloud drive flow depended on the CasaOS-team-hosted OAuth
proxy at `cloudoauth.files.casaos.app`. Keeping it tethered the
product to CasaOS infra forever — incompatible with the v1.0
goal of removing all CasaOS dependencies.

Per #101 option 3, dropped entirely for v1.0 instead of
spinning up our own OAuth proxy (which needs domain + cloud
worker infra + per-provider OAuth app registrations). If we
bring cloud drives back post-v1.0, it'll be on PowerLab-owned
infrastructure with the trust-dance redo (#118) addressed
first.

Removed:
- `backend/local-storage/drivers/` (dropbox, google_drive,
  base, all.go) — 826 LOC
- `backend/local-storage/route/v1/cloud.go` (ListStorages,
  UmountStorage handlers — body was already commented out)
- `backend/local-storage/route/v1/recover.go`
  (GetRecoverStorage OAuth callback flow)
- `backend/local-storage/route/v1/driver.go`
  (ListDriverInfo — fed from internal/op which only existed
  for cloud drivers)
- `backend/local-storage/internal/` entire dir
  (op, driver, sign, conf — all alist-derived cloud-driver
  infrastructure with zero non-cloud callers)

Routes removed:
- GET    /v1/cloud
- DELETE /v1/cloud
- GET    /v1/driver

Net diff: ~1500 LOC removed, zero added. Eliminates the
`cloudoauth.files.casaos.app` external dependency.

- Dead-code cleanup in local-storage. After #139 dropped the
cloud-drive routes, two files lost all production callers
but were missed in that PR's scope:

  backend/local-storage/service/storage.go         (206 LOC)
  backend/local-storage/pkg/utils/httper/drive.go  (161 LOC)

Verified zero non-self callers via grep across the service.
StorageService was still registered in service.go's Services
interface + DI store, but no live code path called
MyService.Storage() — only a commented-out reference in
main.go (kept the kill-PR's TODO marker, now removed too).

Net: 374 LOC removed, zero added.

service.go also pruned: Storage() method, struct field,
NewStorageService() invocation all gone.

- Cloud drive backends (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) and the
/v1/cloud, /v1/driver, /v1/recover endpoints removed from the
core service. Sprint 3 Phase 3 — fifth structural rebrand PR
(#101). Mirrors the local-storage cloud-drive removal in #139,
closing the second half of the cloud-drive surface.

Why: same as #139 — the OAuth flow tied PowerLab to the
CasaOS-team-hosted proxy at `cloudoauth.files.casaos.app`,
incompatible with the v1.0 goal of a clean fork. Hosting our
own OAuth proxy is post-v1.0 work IF cloud drives come back.

### Fixed
- Multiple hardcoded `/var/lib/casaos/...` and `/var/log/casaos/...`
paths in runtime code that survived the #140 etc-paths rebrand
because they reference data/log/share dirs (constants.Default*Path)
rather than config dirs (constants.DefaultConfigPath).

Each is a real production bug: PowerLab installs put data under
`/var/lib/powerlab/`, logs under `/var/log/powerlab/`, and shared
data under `/usr/share/powerlab/`, so the hardcoded `/casaos/`
paths pointed at directories that don't exist.

Fixes:

  backend/app-management/route/v1/docker.go
    dockerRootDirFilePath
    "/var/lib/casaos/docker_root"
    → filepath.Join(constants.DefaultDataPath, "docker_root")

  backend/core/route/v2/health.go
    GetHealthlogs log archiver
    "/var/log/casaos" (3 sites)
    → constants.DefaultLogPath

  backend/core/service/system.go
    GenreateSystemEntry + GetSystemEntry
    "/var/lib/casaos/www/modules" (2 sites)
    → filepath.Join(constants.DefaultDataPath, "www", "modules")

  backend/core/pkg/config/init.go
    AppInfo.ShellPath default
    "/usr/share/casaos/shell"
    → filepath.Join(constants.DefaultConstantPath, "shell")

  backend/local-storage/pkg/config/init.go
    AppInfo.ShellPath default
    "/usr/share/casaos/shell"
    → filepath.Join(constants.DefaultConstantPath, "shell")

  backend/local-storage/route/v2/merge.go
    User-facing error messages mentioned "/var/lib/casaos/files"
    → use the resolved constants.DefaultFilePath value

Held back: backend/common/utils/version/migration.go's
GlobalMigrationStatusDirPath = "/var/lib/casaos/migration" is
intentionally CasaOS-pointed (it tracks legacy CasaOS-→PowerLab
migration status). Belongs to the migration-tool surface that
#140 explicitly held back.

### Internal
- Release v0.5.3 — patch release. Closes the toast/UUID regression
introduced by v0.5.2's HTTPS disable (#137 / crypto.randomUUID
needs secure context, broke on http://IP:port). Plus completes
Sprint 3 Phase 2 migrations (#100): core and local-storage now
use pkg/migrations alongside user-service and message-bus —
AutoMigrate fully retired across all 4 state-owning services.

- Release v0.5.4 — Sprint 3 closeout. The "kill CasaOS" sprint
substantially closes:

  - Cloud drive backends removed from local-storage AND core
    (-1500 + -1862 LOC). Kills the
    `cloudoauth.files.casaos.app` OAuth proxy dependency.

  - Go module paths renamed across all 6 services
    (`github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-*` →
    `github.com/neochaotic/powerlab/backend/*`).

  - Filesystem paths migrated `/etc/casaos` → `/etc/powerlab`
    across 5 services. Plus a real prod bug fix: install.sh
    shipped `casaos.conf.sample` → `/etc/powerlab/casaos.conf`
    while systemd started core with `-c /etc/powerlab/core.conf`,
    dropping every shipped default into nothing. Sample renamed
    `core.conf.sample`.

  - Hardcoded `/var/lib/casaos/...` runtime paths fixed in 6
    files (real prod bugs that pointed at non-existent dirs on
    PowerLab installs).

  - Message-bus topic prefixes rebranded
    (`casaos:* → powerlab:*`).

  - Disk persistence-type discriminator rebranded
    (`PersistentTypeCasaOS → PersistentTypePowerLab`,
    wire value `"casaos" → "powerlab"`).

  - user-service `SERVICENAME` rebranded
    (`"CasaOS-UserService" → "PowerLab-UserService"`) +
    `zimaos:user:save_config` topic rebranded.

  - 165 legacy `logger.X(msg, zap.X(...))` call sites in
    local-storage migrated to `_log.X(ctx, msg, slog.X(...))`
    via `pkg/logging`.

  - Embedded sysroot config samples + dead `casaos.io`
    endpoints purged.

Net: ~3500 LOC removed. Remaining CasaOS surface is in
app-management (Sprint 4 territory, audit at
`docs/audits/sprint-4-app-management-prep.md`).

Process: ADR-0019 codifies the tech-debt tracking pattern
going forward — `docs/audits/` + `docs/decisions/` + labeled
GitHub issues, no `TECH-DEBT.md` at the repo root.

No behavior change for end users beyond the bug fixes above.
Wire-format changes (PersistentType, topic prefixes,
SERVICENAME, casaos_apps key) are pre-v1.0 allowed renames
with no PowerLab UI consumer.



## [v0.5.3] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- core now uses `pkg/migrations` (versioned goose migrations) in
place of GORM's `db.AutoMigrate(...)`. Schema captured by
running existing AutoMigrate against in-memory SQLite and
dumping `sqlite_master` so it matches what installs already
have on disk. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` keeps upgrades safe.
The legacy CasaOS table cleanup (`o_application`, `o_friend`,
`o_person_download`, `o_person_down_record`) that used to live
in `db.Exec` calls right after `AutoMigrate` is now in the
migration SQL itself — co-located with the schema definition.
Plus stripped the legacy LinkLeong file header from `db.go`.
Two new smoke tests in `pkg/sqlite/migrations_test.go` lock
the 4-table schema + idempotent re-run. Third of 4 services
(#100); local-storage remains for Phase 2.4.

- local-storage now uses `pkg/migrations` (versioned goose
migrations) in place of GORM's `db.AutoMigrate(...)`. Final
service of the 4 to retire AutoMigrate per #100. Schema captured
verbatim from existing AutoMigrate output: `o_disk` (Volume,
table-name override preserved for legacy CasaOS compat),
`o_merge` (Merge), `o_merge_disk` (many2many junction with
foreign keys). `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` keeps upgrades
safe. Two new smoke tests in `pkg/sqlite/migrations_test.go`
cover the 3-table schema + idempotent re-run. Closes #100.

### Fixed
- Toast store no longer crashes on `crypto.randomUUID is not a
function` when accessed via insecure context (http://IP:port).
v0.5.2 disabled HTTPS by default per #130; that turned every
fresh install into a non-secure-context environment.
`crypto.randomUUID` requires a secure context (HTTPS, localhost,
or file://); without it, every `toast.add()` threw, no toasts
appeared, and downstream UI flows that depend on toast feedback
(deploy success, save confirmation) silently failed.

Fix: new `$lib/utils/uuid.ts::generateID()` with three-tier
fallback — `crypto.randomUUID` → `crypto.getRandomValues` (Web
Crypto, NOT secure-context-restricted) → `Math.random`
composition (last-resort for old jsdom). Toast store now uses
generateID. 9 regression tests in `uuid.test.ts` cover each
fallback branch + uniqueness.

Surfaced during user testing of v0.5.2 on a fresh
http://192.168.x.y:8765 install.

### Internal
- Release v0.5.2 — incident response patch over v0.5.1. Closes the
v0.5.0 → v0.5.1 in-app upgrade incident class via three coordinated
fixes: install.sh cgroup escape (#129/#132), 4 boot-time gateway
bugs (#131), and surgical HTTPS feature gate (#130/#133). HTTPS is
now opt-in via `POWERLAB_HTTPS_ENABLED=true` and gates re-enable in
v0.6 on trust-dance redo (#118) + integration tests. Plus the
message-bus migration adoption (#127) from Sprint 3 Phase 2.



## [v0.5.2] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- message-bus now uses `pkg/migrations` (versioned goose migrations)
in place of GORM's `db.AutoMigrate(...)`. The service has TWO
embedded migration filesystems — `migrations_events` (event_types,
action_types, property_types + the two many2many junction tables)
and `migrations_persist` (settings, ysk_cards) — because each
goose run owns its own goose_db_version sequence per DB. The
0001_initial.sql files were captured by running the existing
AutoMigrate against an in-memory SQLite and dumping
`sqlite_master` so the schema matches what existing installs
already have on disk; `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` keeps
upgrades safe. Two new smoke tests in `repository_test.go`
cover both DBs. Fixed `NewDatabaseRepositoryInMemory()` to use
distinct named in-memory shared caches per DB — previously both
used `file::memory:?cache=shared` (same identifier = same
backing store), which made goose's version table conflict
between the two migration runs.

- HTTPS feature is now opt-in via `POWERLAB_HTTPS_ENABLED=true`
environment variable (default: gated). Closes #130.

When gated:
- Cert manager `Setup()` is a no-op — no CA generated, no
  server cert written
- Cert download endpoints (`.crt`, `.mobileconfig`, `.cer`,
  `ca-certificate` redirect) return 503 with
  `{code: "https.gated", message: ...}` JSON
- Trust mutations (`/v1/sys/trust-confirmed`, `/v1/sys/rotate-ca`)
  return the same 503
- HSTS header NOT emitted on HTTP requests; emitted as
  `max-age=0` on HTTPS requests to actively reset cached HSTS
  in already-locked browsers
- HTTP→HTTPS 301 redirect is suppressed; users access the
  panel directly on port 8765
- HTTPS listener (8443) is not bound (cert files don't exist
  so the existing graceful skip in main.go fires)
- Read-only `/v1/sys/trust-state` is INTENTIONALLY NOT gated
  so the UI can render the gated banner

When the env var is set to exactly `"true"` (strict comparison —
no "1" / "yes" / "TRUE"), the full HTTPS flow is restored. v0.6
ships with HTTPS re-enabled by default after trust-dance redo
(#118) and integration tests land.

Surgical change — no code deletion, no frontend changes. Re-enable
in v0.6 = flip one default. New `pkg/security.HTTPSEnabled()`
helper + 11 regression tests across 3 test files lock the gate
shape.

### Fixed
- In-app upgrade no longer kills install.sh mid-flight (#129).
Previously `core` spawned `install.sh` with
`SysProcAttr.Setsid=true`, betting that escaping the SESSION
would prevent SIGTERM propagation when install.sh ran
`systemctl stop powerlab-core`. But systemd tracks units by
CGROUP, not session — so the default `KillMode=control-group`
on `powerlab-core.service` sent SIGTERM to every process in
core's cgroup, INCLUDING install.sh. Result: binaries copied,
services stopped, restart loop never executed → users locked
out. Now `core` spawns install.sh via `systemd-run --no-block
--collect --unit=powerlab-upgrade ...` which creates a
transient systemd scope unit with its own cgroup. install.sh
survives the stop of core and completes the upgrade-restart-
health-check cycle as designed. Two regression tests in
`powerlab_updater_test.go` lock the spawn pattern (must use
systemd-run, must NOT set SysProcAttr).

- Gateway: 4 boot-time SIGSEGV / infinite-loop bugs surfaced during the
v0.5.0 → v0.5.1 in-app upgrade incident (#130). All in
`backend/gateway/main.go`:

1. `checkURL` nil-deref on err path — bug-#64 ressuscitado: original
   code did `defer response.Body.Close()` unconditionally even when
   `http.Get` returned `(nil, err)`. Was thought "structurally
   closed" by `pkg/foundation.RecoverMiddleware` but that
   middleware only covers HTTP handlers — not boot-time fx OnStart
   hooks where checkURL runs. Fixed by checking err FIRST.

2. `checkURL` StatusCode logic was inverted (`== StatusOK`
   returned `ErrCheckURLNotOK`). Worked-by-accident because
   bug 1 returned early on success. Now: any HTTP response
   means the listener is up (preserves boot semantics where the
   gateway redirects HTTP→HTTPS with 301 — checking for 200
   would loop forever).

3. `reloadGateway` self-ping URL constructed from `listener.Addr()`
   which returns the BIND address (`[::]:PORT`) — invalid as TCP
   CLIENT destination on IPv6-strict configs (`http.Get` to `[::]`
   fails). Fixed by new `clientLoopback()` helper that rewrites
   bind addresses to 127.0.0.1.

4. `checkURLWithRetry` used `count uint` with `for count >= 0;
   count--`. uint never goes negative; `count--` from 0 wraps to
   MAX_UINT64 → infinite retry. Combined with bug 3 (the URL was
   unreachable), this turned the gateway into a 100% CPU spinner
   that blocked all subsequent fx OnStart hooks (HTTPS, static, etc.)
   from running, leaving 8443 unbound and users locked out by HSTS.
   Fixed by switching to `int` with bounded `for i := 0; i <= retry`.

Plus an init() restructure: skip the heavy startup work (flag.Parse,
config load, logger init) in test binaries — `flag.Parse` was
rejecting `-test.*` flags and crashing the test binary. Also adds
7 regression tests in `main_check_url_test.go` covering all 4 bugs
+ happy paths.

### Internal
- Release v0.5.1 — bug-fix patch over v0.5.0. Three user-reported
bugs from the v0.5.0 testing session are addressed: discoverable
file selection on Files page (#121), cert download diagnostics
on Settings (#124), and orchestrator deploy phase indicator +
timeout parity with native-app install (#125). Plus pkg/migrations
foundation (#115) and user-service migration adoption (#117) from
Sprint 3 Phase 1-2.



## [v0.5.1] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- `backend/pkg/migrations` — a thin wrapper over `pressly/goose/v3`
that gives every PowerLab service a versioned, transactional,
rollbackable schema migration runner. Three exported functions:
`Up(ctx, db, fsys, dir)`, `Down(ctx, db, fsys, dir)`,
`Version(ctx, db) (int64, error)`. Six TDD'd tests cover happy
path, idempotency, partial-already-applied, malformed-SQL-fails,
fresh-DB-returns-zero, and Down rollback. `Version` queries
`goose_db_version` directly so it can be called from health
endpoints without threading a migration FS. Lays the foundation
for retiring `db.AutoMigrate(...)` across all four
state-owning services in subsequent Sprint 3 PRs (see ADR-0018
for the rationale and goose-vs-golang-migrate-vs-atlas
comparison).

### Changed
- user-service now uses `pkg/migrations` (versioned goose
migrations) in place of GORM's `db.AutoMigrate(...)`. Schema
is captured in `backend/user-service/pkg/sqlite/migrations/0001_initial.sql`
and embedded in the binary via `embed.FS`. Existing installs
continue to work because the migration uses
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — running it on a DB that already
has the tables (created previously by AutoMigrate) is a safe
no-op that simply records the schema as version 1 in
`goose_db_version`. Two new tests in `pkg/sqlite` smoke the
embedded migrations: `TestEmbeddedMigrations_Up_ProducesExpectedTables`
and `TestEmbeddedMigrations_Up_Idempotent`. First service to
retire AutoMigrate; message-bus, core, local-storage follow
in subsequent PRs.

- Custom-app deploy (#116 item 3): the orchestrator's deploy
overlay now shows the same `Phase N/M — label` indicator and
progress bar that the native-app install overlay has, parsed
from the SSE log stream via the existing `parseLatestPhase`
helper. Adds a 10-minute safety timeout (matches native-app
`streamInstallLogs`); when the SSE stream wedges past that
window the overlay surfaces a "taking longer than expected"
banner instead of spinning silently. Existing
`install-phase.test.ts` (12 tests) covers the parsing; the
wiring is template-only.

- Settings → CA certificate download UX (#118): the
"Could not download the certificate" toast now includes the
HTTP status code and (when short) the response body excerpt.
Empty-body responses produce a distinct "(empty body)" toast
instead of a silent dropped download. Both branches also log
the failure context to the browser console so the next bug
report has a fingerprint to act on. Diagnostic-only change —
the underlying #118 fix (rebuild trusted-dance flow) requires
the extraction tracked in #123 first to be safely
regression-tested.

### Fixed
- Files page (#116 item 1): adds an always-visible checkbox column
to FileTable so users can select files without needing to know
about Cmd/Ctrl/Shift-click. The Delete button in the toolbar
already shows when `selectedCount > 0` — the missing piece was
a discoverable selection affordance. Header checkbox toggles
select-all / deselect-all. Row checkboxes don't propagate clicks
so they don't fire the row's open handler (selecting and opening
are now cleanly separated).

Adds 3 regression tests (`FileTable.test.ts`) locking: checkboxes
render per row, click-to-select fires onSelect, and clicking a
checkbox does NOT fire onOpen.

Adds 1 regression test (`TextEditor.test.ts`) covering the
create-flow save → toast.success path (#116 item 1, save toast
half). The PUT-path equivalent is intentionally skipped at the
vitest level because jsdom + CodeMirror don't simulate typing
reliably enough to flip isDirty; that path is queued for
Playwright coverage in #108.

Adds ResizeObserver no-op polyfill to dom-polyfills so component
tests that observe their container size (FileTable here, others
later) don't throw at render time.

### Internal
- Release v0.5.0 — Sprint 2 ships. CHANGELOG.md generated from the
unreleased fragments via `changie batch v0.5.0` + `changie merge`,
consumed fragments archived to `.changes/v0.5.0.md`. This is
the first release using the changie workflow #98 introduced.



## [v0.5.0] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- Migrate the easy slice of `local-storage` logging to PowerLab's
`pkg/logging` (slog-based, with correlation-ID propagation):
`main.go`'s `main()` and `RegMsg()` functions, plus all of
`misc.go` (uevent monitor + disk/usb notify helpers). Logs now
carry `request_id` / `correlation_id` automatically when emitted
from contexts that have one, and structured attrs use `slog.Attr`
instead of `zap.Field`. The remaining ~190 call sites across
`route/`, `service/`, `drivers/`, `internal/`, `pkg/utils/*`,
`cmd/migration-tool/` are tracked in #104 — they need
`ctx`-threading work that doesn't belong in this PR. The legacy
`logger.LogInit` call and `init()`-context legacy logger calls
remain in place because `_log` is constructed in `main()` and is
nil at init-time; they migrate together with the init refactor
in part 4.

- Wire PowerLab foundation middleware into the `local-storage`
service: `wrapWithFoundation` applies `pkgtracing.Middleware`
(correlation IDs via X-Request-Id) and
`pkglifecycle.RecoverMiddleware` (panic recovery, logs with
stack + correlation ID, writes 500 via `pkg/errors.WriteHTTP`)
around the single `http.Server.Handler`. Goroutines spawned from
`main()` (uevent monitor, storage stats, message-bus event
registration, disk init check) now run via `pkglifecycle.SafeGo`
so a panic in any of them is recovered and logged rather than
crashing the process. Goroutines spawned from `init()` retain
their bare `go fn()` calls because `_log` is not yet constructed
at init time (will be addressed in part 4 cleanup or absorbed
by the logger migration in part 3). Closes the bug-#64 SIGSEGV
class within the local-storage process.

- Rebrand user-facing surface in the `local-storage` service: error
message returned when a referenced volume is not PowerLab-managed
now reads "PowerLab storage" (was "CasaOS storage"); legacy CasaOS
IDE-generated file headers stripped from `route/v1/storage.go`,
`model/disk.go`, `service/model/o_volume.go`; internal comments
mentioning "CasaOS UI" updated to "PowerLab UI". Dev-only path
defaults for non-Linux developer environments rebranded
(`C:\\PowerLab\\DATA`, `./PowerLab/DATA`). Structural CasaOS
dependencies (filesystem paths under `/etc/casaos` and
`/var/lib/casaos/files`, the `casaos:file:recover` message-bus
topic, the `PersistentTypeCasaOS` DB constant, and the
`cloudoauth.files.casaos.app` OAuth proxy) are deferred to #101
because each requires a deliberate migration plan rather than a
textual rename.

- Sprint 2 Kill #4 (user-service) bundled middleware + logger
migration. Wires PowerLab foundation middleware
(`pkgtracing.Middleware` for correlation IDs +
`pkglifecycle.RecoverMiddleware` for panic recovery) around the
user-service's `http.Server.Handler`. Migrates all 25 active
legacy `CasaOS-Common/utils/logger` call sites in `main.go`,
`route/event_listen.go`, `route/v1/user.go`, `service/user.go`,
and `pkg/sqlite/db.go` to PowerLab's `pkg/logging` (slog-based,
with `correlation_id` propagation from request context).
Introduces per-package `logger.go` files with
`var _log` + `SetLogger(l)` setters following the gateway pattern;
`main()` constructs the foundation logger and overrides each
package's `_log` so all log lines flow through one instance.
Drops `go.uber.org/zap` from every migrated file. The
`EventListen` goroutine now runs via `pkglifecycle.SafeGo` so a
panic in the websocket loop is recovered and logged rather than
crashing the process. `logger.LogInit` is removed entirely —
user-service no longer uses the CasaOS-Common legacy logger
outside `cmd/migration-tool` (which has its own `_logger`
package-local variable, unrelated). Structural CasaOS items
(filesystem paths, the `SERVICENAME` constant, the
`zimaos:user:save_config` event name) are deferred to #106
because they require migration plans, not text changes.

### Internal
- Sprint 2 Phase 6 (Airflow-level docs commitment, Phase 2 of three):
godoc completeness on the public symbols touched by the Sprint 2
kills. Specifically: `EventListen` (user-service event-bus loop),
`RegMsg` (local-storage event-type registration), `GetDb`
(user-service SQLite singleton), `NewUserService` (user-service
constructor + JWT keypair lifecycle), and
`MessageMergerFSNotEnabled` (local-storage merge endpoint
503 message). Each comment starts with the symbol name per Go
godoc convention and explains the non-obvious why (e.g. why
GetDb sets MaxOpenConns=1, why NewUserService deliberately
loses sessions on restart). Stale Chinese comment removed from
NewUserService.

- Stand up the Playwright E2E baseline for the SvelteKit frontend.
`ui/playwright.config.ts` boots the dev server automatically and
runs chromium on `http://localhost:5173`. `npm run test:e2e`
runs the suite locally; CI runs it via the new
`Frontend E2E (Playwright)` job. The baseline ships with one
smoke test (`tests/smoke.spec.ts`) proving the pipeline works
end-to-end. Two pre-existing specs (`auth.spec.broken.ts.txt`,
`orchestrator.spec.broken.ts.txt`) were renamed with the
`.broken.ts.txt` extension so Playwright skips them — they were
written against a UI revision predating the launchpad clock
redesign and the `/apps/new` rework, and need rewrites. Real
per-area test coverage is tracked in #108.

- Adopt changie for changelog fragment workflow (#98). Each PR adds
a tiny YAML fragment under .changes/unreleased/; release time
aggregates fragments into a single CHANGELOG section. Eliminates
the conflict-on-CHANGELOG class that consumed merge-cascade time
during Sprint 1 (~5-10 min per cascade).

- Extract the foundation middleware composition (`pkgtracing.Middleware`
+ `pkglifecycle.RecoverMiddleware`) into `pkg/foundation.Wrap`,
making it the single source of truth for how every PowerLab service
wraps its `http.Server.Handler`. Each service's `main.go` now
delegates to this helper instead of inlining the chain — closes the
bug class where four duplicated compositions could silently drift
apart. Six new unit tests in `pkg/foundation` cover the full
contract: pass-through happy path, panic-yields-500, panic log
carries `correlation_id`, happy-path correlation propagation,
pkg/errors.WriteHTTP body envelope shape, nil-logger tolerance.
This fills the integration-layer test gap surfaced during the
Sprint 2 stabilization audit (mechanical wirings without
per-service coverage). Subsequent `pkglifecycle` / `pkgtracing`
unused imports dropped from gateway / message-bus / local-storage /
user-service main.go where they are no longer referenced
directly.

- Sprint 2 Phase 5 closer — three pre-tag gates that were missing.
(1) Verified `changie batch --dry-run v0.5.0` end-to-end: all 8
unreleased fragments aggregate cleanly into a `## [v0.5.0]`
section with the right kind groupings — the workflow #98
introduced now has empirical proof of working at tag time.
(2) Added `Frontend E2E (Playwright)` to branch-protection
required status checks so the job introduced by #109 actually
gates merges instead of being a passive CI signal.
(3) Added `docs/release-checklist.md` — the authoritative
playbook for cutting a PowerLab release, split into
Phase 1 (verification, ~10min) and Phase 2 (release, ~5min)
with a separate v1.0 gate covering contract, docs site,
pkg/migrations exercise, and explicit user sign-off. All three
gaps were surfaced during the post-#111 stabilization audit.
